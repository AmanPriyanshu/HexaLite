 Hansmann ( 
Per-
vasive Computing: The Mobile World
 
, 2nd ed., Springer, 2003 reprinted 2013) deﬁ
 ne the 
principles of context in mobile computing. Books by Kuniavsky ( Smart Things: Ubiqui-tous Computing User Experience Design 
, Morgan Kaufman, 2010) and Polstad ( Ubiquitous Computing: Smart Devices, Environments and Interactions
 
, Wiley, 2009) describes the 
context-aware computing in terms of the interactions among smart devices, smart envi-
ronments, and smart interactions. Neil ( Mobile Design Pattern Gallery 
, O’Reilly, 2012) docu-
ments mobile design patterns illustrated by examples from six mobile platforms.   
 
Interface design books are plentiful. A good general reference is the book edited by Schumacher ( Handbook of Global User Research
 
, Morgan-Kaufmann, 2009). Hoober  ( Designing Mobile Interfaces 
, O’Reilly, 2011) describes device-independent best practices 
for composing pages, displaying information, and using sensors. Nielsen ( Mobile Usability 
, New Riders, 2012) offers advice on how to design usable interfaces that take mobile-device 
screen size into account. Colborne ( Simple and Usable Web, Mobile, and Interaction Design
 
, New Riders, 2010) describes the process of simplifying user interaction. Ginsburg ( Design-ing the iPhone User Experience: A User-Centered Approach to Sketching and Prototyping 

iPhone Apps 
, Addison-Wesley, 2010) discusses the importance of differentiating your app 
from the competition by taking a user-centric approach to designing a high-quality user 

experience.   
 
The  Microsoft Application Architecture Guide
 
 (Microsoft Press, 2009) 
 
 contains useful in-
formation about mobile application design and architecture. Architecture design for tab-
let devices is discussed in a book by Lee ( Mobile Applications: Architecture, Design, and 
 Development 
, Prentice Hall, 2004). Esposito ( Architecting Mobile Solutions for the Enterprise
 
, Microsoft Press, 2012) describes the process of developing a cross-platform application by 
building an effective mobile website. Mobile middleware is discussed in a book edited by 
Garbinato ( Middleware for Network Eccentric and Mobile Applications
 
, Springer, 2009). 
  
 
There are many books on MobileApp programming that focus on a speciﬁ c platform. 
Books by Firtman ( Programming the Mobile Web, 
 O’Reilly, 2010). Mednieke ( 
Programming 
Android, 
 O’Reilly, 2011) or Lee ( 
Test-Driven iOS Development, 
 Addison-Wesley, 2012) are 
representative.   
 
A wide variety of information sources on design for MobileApps is available on the  Internet. An up-to-date list of World Wide Web references can be found under “software 
engineering resources” at the SEPA website:
