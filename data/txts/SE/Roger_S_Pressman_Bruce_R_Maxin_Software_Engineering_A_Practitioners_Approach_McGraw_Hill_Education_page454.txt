QUALITY MANAGEMENTin 150 critical errors going undetected and uncorrected. The cost of ﬁ nding and ﬁ
 xing 
these remaining 150 defects in the maintenance phase (150 3 $14,102) would have 
been $2,115,300. Thus, the total cost of ﬁ nding and ﬁ
 xing the 200 defects after the 
 coding phase would have been $2,472,100 ($2,115,300 1 $356,800).   
Even if your software organization has costs that are half of industry average (most have no idea what their costs are!), the cost savings associated with early 
quality control and assurance activities (conducted during requirements analy-
sis and design) are compelling.

The scene:  Doug Miller’s ofﬁ
 ce 
as the  SafeHome 
 software project begins.   
The players:  Doug Miller (manager of the 
 
SafeHome 
 software engineering team) and other members of the 
product software engineering team.   
The conversation:    
Doug:  I was looking at an industry report on the costs 
of repairing software defects. They are pretty sobering.   
Jamie:  We are already working on developing test 
cases for each functional requirement.   
Doug:  That’s good, but I was noticing that it costs eight 
times as much to repair a defect that is discovered in 
testing than it does if the defect is caught and repaired 
during coding.   
Vinod:  We are using pairs programming so we should 
be able to catch most of the defects during coding.   
Doug:  I think you are missing the point. Quality is 
more than simply removing coding errors. We need 

to look at the project quality goals and ensure that the 
evolving software products are meeting them.   
Jamie:  Do you mean things like usability, security, and 
reliability?   
Doug:  Yes, I do. We need to build checks into the soft-
ware process to monitor our progress toward meeting 
our quality goals.   
Vinod:  Can’t we ﬁ
 nish the ﬁ
 rst prototype and then 
check it for quality?   
Doug:  I am afraid not. We must establish a culture of 
quality early in the project.   
Vinod:  What do you want us to do, Doug? 
  
Doug:  I think we will need to ﬁ
 nd a technique that will 
allow us to monitor the quality of the  SafeHome 
  products. 
Let’s think about this and revisit this again tomorrow.

Risks  
In Chapter 1 of this book, we wrote “people bet their jobs, their comforts, their safety, their entertainment, their decisions, and their very lives on computer soft-

ware. It better be right.” The implication is that low-quality software increases 
risks for both the developer and the end user. In the preceding subsection, we 

discussed one of these risks (cost). But the downside of poorly designed and im-
plemented applications does not always stop with dollars and time. An extreme 
example [Gag04] might serve to illustrate.  Throughout the month of November 2000 at a hospital in Panama, 28 patients received massive overdoses of gamma rays during treatment for a variety of can-
cers. In the months that followed, 5 of these patients died from radiation poison-
ing and 15 others developed serious complications. What caused this tragedy? pre22126_ch19_411-430.indd   424pre22126_ch19_411-430.indd   42413/12/13   6:13 PM13/12/13   6:13 PM
