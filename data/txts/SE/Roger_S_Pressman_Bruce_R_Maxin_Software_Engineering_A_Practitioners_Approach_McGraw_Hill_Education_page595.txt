25.7.  Is it fair to say that the overall WebApp testing strategy begins with user-visible ele-
ments and moves toward technology elements? Are there exceptions to this strategy?    
 
25.8.  Is content testing  really
 
 testing in a conventional sense? Explain.    
 
25.9.  Describe the steps associated with database testing for a WebApp. Is database testing 
predominantly a client-side or server-side activity? 
   
 
25.10.  What is the difference between testing that is associated with interface mechanisms and testing that addresses interface semantics?    
 
25.11.  Assume that you are developing an online pharmacy ( YourCornerPharmacy.com
 
) that caters to senior citizens. The pharmacy provides typical functions, but also maintains 
a database for each customer so that it can provide drug information and warn of potential 
drug interactions. Discuss any special usability tests for this WebApp. 
   
 
25.12.  Assume that you have implemented a drug interaction checking function for  YourCornerPharmacy.com
 
 (Problem 20.11). Discuss the types of component-level tests that 
would have to be conducted to ensure that this function works properly. (Note: A database 

would have to be used to implement this function.)    
 
25.13.  What is the difference between testing for navigation syntax and navigation semantics?    
 
25.14.  Is it possible to test every conﬁ guration that a WebApp is likely to encounter on the 
server side? On the client side? If it is not, how do you select a meaningful set of conﬁ gura-
tion tests?    
 
25.15.  What is the objective of security testing? Who performs this testing activity?    
 
25.16.   
YourCornerPharmacy.com
 
 (Problem 25.11) has become wildly successful, and the 
number of users has increased dramatically in the ﬁ rst two months of operation. Draw a 
graph that depicts probable response time as a function of number of users for a ﬁ xed set of 
server-side resources. Label the graph to indicate points of interest on the “response curve.” 
   
 
25.17.  In response to it, success  YourCornerPharmacy.com
 
 (Problem 25.11) has imple-
mented a special server solely to handle prescription reﬁ lls. On average, 1000 concurrent 
users submit a reﬁ ll request once every two minutes. The WebApp downloads a 500-byte 
block of data in response. What is the approximate required throughput for this server in 
megabits per second?    
 
25.18.  What is the difference between load testing and stress testing?

 READINGS AND INFORMATION
 SOURCES  
 
The literature for WebApp testing continues to evolve. Books by Andrews and Whittaker 
( How to Break Web Software,
 
Addison-Wesley, 2006), Ash ( 
The Web Testing Companion,
 
 Wiley, 
2003), Nguyen and his colleagues ( Testing Applications for the Web,
 
 2nd ed., Wiley, 2003), 
Dustin and his colleagues ( Quality Web Systems,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 2002), and Splaine and 
Jaskiel [Spl01] are among the most complete treatments of the subject published to date. 
Whitaker and his colleagues describe additional web testing practices ( How Google Tests 
Software,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 2012). Mosley ( 
Client-Server Software Testing on the Desktop and 
the Web,
 
 Prentice Hall, 1999) addresses both client-side and server-side testing issues. 
  
 
Useful information of WebApp testing strategies and methods, as well as a worthwhile 
discussion of automated testing tools is presented by David ( Selenium 2 Testing Tools: A 
Beginner’s Guide,
 
 Packit Publishing, 2012) and Stottlemeyer ( 
Automated Web Testing Toolkit,
 
 Wiley, 2001). Graham and her colleagues ( 
Experiences of Test Automation,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 
2012) and ( Software Test Automation,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 1999) present additional material on 
automated tools. pre22126_ch25_540-566.indd   565pre22126_ch25_540-566.indd   56513/12/13   6:15 PM13/12/13   6:15 PM
