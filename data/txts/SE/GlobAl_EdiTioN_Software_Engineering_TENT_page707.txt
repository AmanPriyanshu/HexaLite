2. Process standards 
These define the processes that should be followed during 
software development. They should encapsulate good development practice. 

Process standards may include definitions of specification, design, and valida
-
tion processes, process support tools, and a description of the documents that 

should be written during these processes.Examples of product and process standards that may be used are shown in 
Figure 24.4.
Standards have to deliver value, in the form of increased product quality. There is no 
point in defining standards that are expensive in terms of time and effort to apply that only 

lead to marginal improvements in quality. Product standards have to be designed so that 

they can be applied and checked in a cost-effective way, and process standards should 

include the definition of processes that check if product standards have been followed.The software engineering standards that are used within a company are usually adapted from broader national or international standards. National and international 
standards have been developed covering software engineering terminology, pro-
gramming languages such as Java and C++, notations such as charting symbols, 

procedures for deriving and writing software requirements, quality assurance proce-
dures, and software verification and validation processes (IEEE 2003). More spe-
cialized standards have been developed for safety and security critical systems.Software engineers sometimes consider standards to be overprescriptive and 
irrelevant to the technical activity of software development. This is particularly 

likely when project standards require tedious documentation and work recording. 

Although they usually agree about the general need for standards, engineers often 
find good reasons why standards are not necessarily appropriate to their particular 
project. Quality managers who set the standards should therefore consider possible 
actions to convince engineers of the value of standards:1. Involve software engineers in the selection of product standards If developers understand why standards have been selected, they are more likely to be com-
mitted to these standards. Ideally, the standards document should not just set out 

the standard to be followed but should also include commentary explaining why 

standardization decisions have been made.Product standardsProcess standardsDesign review formDesign review conductRequirements document structureSubmission of new code for system building
