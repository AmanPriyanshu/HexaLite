More and more systems are safety-critical systems, where system failure 
can endanger people. Chapter 12 is concerned with safety engineering 

and techniques that may be used to develop these safety-critical systems. 

I explain why safety is a broader notion than reliability and discuss meth-
ods for deriving system safety requirements. I also explain why defined 

and documented processes for safety-critical systems engineering are 

important and describe software safety casesŠstructured documents 

that are used to justify why a system is safe.
Threats to the security of our systems are one of the major problems 
faced by today™s societies and I devote two chapters to this topic. 

Chapter 13 is concerned with application security engineeringŠ
 methods 
used to achieve security in individual software systems. I explain the 

relationships between security and other dependability attributes and 

cover security requirements engineering, secure systems design and 

security testing.
Chapter 14 is a new chapter that addresses the broader issue of resil
-ience. A resilient system can continue to deliver its essential services 

even when individual parts of the system fail or are subject to a cyberat
-
tack. I explain the basics of cybersecurity and discuss how resilience is 
achieved by using redundancy and diversity and by empowering people 
as well as through technical mechanisms. Finally, I discuss systems and 

software design issues that can contribute to improving the resilience of 

a system.
