 Use cases are discussed in Chapter 16. Fourth, a use case is a description of set of sequence of actions that a system performs that yields an observable result of value to a particular actor. A use case is used to structure the behavioral things in a model. A use case is realized by a collaboration. Graphically, a use case is rendered as an ellipse with solid lines, usually including only its name, as in Figure 2-4. Figure 2-4 Use Cases  The remaining three things#active classes, components, and nodes#are all class-like, meaning they also describe a set of objects that share the same attributes, operations, relationships, and semantics. However, these three are different enough and are necessary for modeling certain aspects of an object-oriented system, and so they warrant special treatment. Active classes are discussed in Chapter 22. Fifth, an active class is a class whose objects own one or more processes or threads and therefore can initiate control activity. An active class is just like a class except that its objects represent elements whose behavior is concurrent with other elements. Graphically, an active class is rendered just like a class, but with heavy lines, usually including its name, attributes, and operations, as in Figure 2-5. Figure 2-5 Active Classes  The remaining two elements#component, and nodes#are also different. They represent physical things, whereas the previous five things represent conceptual or logical things.
