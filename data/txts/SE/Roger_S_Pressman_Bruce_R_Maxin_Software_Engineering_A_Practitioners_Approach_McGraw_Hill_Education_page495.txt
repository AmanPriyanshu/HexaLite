SOFTWARE QUALITY ASSURANCE
 465House, 2003), and Nance and Arthur ( Managing Software Quality,
 
 Springer, 2002) are excel-
lent management-level presentations on the beneﬁ ts of formal quality assurance programs 
for computer software. Books by Deming [Dem86], Defoe and Juran ( Juran’s Quality Hand-
book, 
 6th ed., McGraw-Hill, 2010), Juran ( Juran on Quality by Design, 
 Free Press, 1992), and Crosby ([Cro79] and  Quality Is Still Free,
 
 McGraw-Hill, 1995) do not focus on software, but 
are must reading for senior managers with software development responsibility. Gluckman 

and Roome ( Everyday Heroes of the Quality Movement,
 
 Dorset House, 1993) humanizes 
quality issues by telling the story of the players in the quality process. Kan ( Metrics and Models in Software Quality Engineering,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 1995) presents a quantitative view 
of software quality. 
  
 
Work by Evans ( 
Quality & Performance Excellence, 
 South-Western College Publishing, 
2007) and ( Total Quality: Management, Organization and Strategy,
 
 4th ed., South-Western 
College Publishing, 2004), Bru ( Six Sigma for Managers, 
 McGraw-Hill, 2005), and Dobb ( 
ISO 9001:2000 Quality Registration Step-by-Step, 
 3rd ed., Butterworth-Heinemann, 2004) are rep-
resentative of the many books written on TQM, Six Sigma, and ISO 9001:2000, respectively.

comprehensive discussions of software and system safety published to date. In addition, 
van der Meulen ( Deﬁ nitions for Hardware and Software Safety Engineers,
 
 Springer-Verlag, 
2000) offers a complete compendium of important concepts and terms for reliability and 
safety; Gardiner ( Testing Safety-Related Software,
 
 Springer-Verlag, 1999) provides special-
ized guidance for testing safety critical systems; Friedman and Voas ( 
Software Assessment: 
Reliability Safety and Testability,
 
 Wiley, 1995) provide useful models for assessing reliability 
and safety. Ericson ( 
Hazard Analysis Primer,
 
 CreateSpace Independent Publishing Plat-
form, 2012) and ( Hazard Analysis Techniques for System Safety,
 
 Wiley, 2005) addresses the 
increasingly important domain of hazard analysis.
