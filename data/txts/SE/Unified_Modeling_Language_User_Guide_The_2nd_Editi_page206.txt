 Terms and Concepts An interaction diagram shows an interaction, consisting of a set of objects and their relationships, including the messages that may be dispatched among them. A sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that emphasizes the time ordering of messages. Graphically, a sequence diagram is a table that shows objects arranged along the X axis and messages, ordered in increasing time, along the Y axis. A collaboration diagram is an interaction diagram that emphasizes the structural organization of the objects that send and receive messages. Graphically, a collaboration diagram is a collection of vertices and arcs. Common Properties The general properties of diagrams are discussed in Chapter 7. An interaction diagram is just a special kind of diagram and shares the same common properties as do all other diagrams#a name and graphical contents that are a projection into a model. What distinguishes an interaction diagram from all other kinds of diagrams is its particular content. Contents Objects are discussed in Chapter 13; links are discussed in Chapters 14 and 15; messages are discussed in Chapter 15; interactions are discussed in Chapter 15.
