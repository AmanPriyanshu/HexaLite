is concerned with managing a company™s reusable 
components, ensuring that they are properly catalogued, stored, and made avail-
able for reuse.3. Component certification is the process of checking a component and certifying 
that it meets its specification.Components maintained by an organization may be stored in a component repos-itory that includes both the components and information about their use.CBSE for reuse is the process of developing reusable components and making them 
available for reuse through a component management system. The vision of early 

supporters of CBSE (Szyperski 2002) was that a thriving component marketplace 

would develop. There would be specialist component providers and component ven-
dors who would organize the sale of components from different developers. Software 
developers would buy components to include in a system or pay for services as they 

were used. However, this vision has not been realized. There are relatively few com
-
ponent suppliers, and buying off-the-shelf components is uncommon.Consequently, CBSE for reuse is mostly used within organizations that have 
made a commitment to reuse-driven software engineering. These companies have a 
base of internally developed components that can be reused. However, these inter-
nally developed components may not be reusable without change. They often include 
application-specific features and interfaces that are unlikely to be required in other 
programs where the component is reused.CBSE for
