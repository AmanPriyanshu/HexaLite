˜The aims of the requirements elicitation process are to understand the work that 
stakeholders do and how they might use a new system to help support that work. 

During requirements elicitation, software engineers work with stakeholders to find 
out about the application domain, work activities, the services and system features 

that stakeholders want, the required performance of the system, hardware con
-straints, and so on.Eliciting and understanding requirements from system stakeholders is a difficult 
process for several reasons:1. Stakeholders often don™t know what they want from a computer system except in the most general terms; they may find it difficult to articulate what they want 
the system to do; they may make unrealistic demands because they don™t know 
what is and isn™t feasible.RequirementsspecificationRequirementsvalidationRequirementselicitationSystem requirements
