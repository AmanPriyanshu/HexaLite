˜The difficulty with experience-based techniques is that a new software project 
may not have much in common with previous projects. Software development 
changes very quickly, and a project will often use unfamiliar techniques such as web 
services, application system configuration, or HTML5. If you have not worked with 

these techniques, your previous experience may not help you to estimate the effort 
required, making it more difficult to produce accurate costs and schedule estimates.It is impossible to say whether experience-based or algorithmic approaches are more accurate. Project estimates are often self-fulfilling. The estimate is used to 

define the project budget, and the product is adjusted so that the budget figure is real-
ized. A project that is within budget may have achieved this at the expense of fea-
tures in the software being developed.To make a comparison of the accuracy of these techniques, a number of controlled 
experiments would be required where several techniques were used independently to 

estimate the project effort and costs. No changes to the project would be allowed, and the 

final effort could them be compared. The project manager would not know the effort 

estimates, so no bias would be introduced. However, this scenario is completely impos-sible in real projects, so we will never have an objective comparison of these approaches.˘˘Algorithmic cost modeling uses a mathematical formula to predict project costs 

based on estimates of the project size, the type of software being developed, and 

other team, process, and product factors. Algorithmic cost models are developed by 
analyzing the costs and attributes of completed projects, then finding the closest-fit 
formula to the actual costs incurred.Algorithmic cost models are primarily used to make estimates of software devel-opment costs. However, Boehm and his collaborators (B. W. Boehm et al. 2000) 

discuss a range of other uses for these models, such as the preparation of estimates 
for investors in software companies, alternative strategies to help assess risks and to 
inform decisions about reuse, redevelopment, or outsourcing.Most algorithmic models for estimating effort in a software project are based on a 
simple formula:Effort = A 3 SizeB 3 MA: a constant factor, which depends on local organizational practices and the type of software that is developed.Size: an assessment of the code size of the software or a functionality estimate 
expressed in function or application points.B: represents the complexity of the software and usually lies between 1 and 1.5.M: is a factor that takes into account process, product and development attributes, 
such as the dependability requirements for the software and the experience of the 
development team. These attributes may increase or decrease the overall diffi-
culty of developing the system.
