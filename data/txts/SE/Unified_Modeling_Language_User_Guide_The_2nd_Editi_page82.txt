For example, suppose you want to tie the models you create to your project's configuration management system. Among other things, this means keeping track of the version number, current check in/check out status, and perhaps even the creation and modification dates of each subsystem. Because this is process-specific information, it is not a basic part of the UML, although you can add this information as tagged values. Furthermore, this information is not just a class attribute either. A subsystem's version number is part of its metadata, not part of the model. Figure 6-10 shows four subsystems, each of which has been extended to include its version number and status. In the case of the Billing subsystem, one other tagged value is shown#the person who has currently checked out the subsystem. Figure 6-10 Modeling New Properties  Note The values of tags such as version and status are things that can be set by tools. Rather than setting these values in your model by hand, you can use a development environment that integrates your configuration management tools with your modeling tools to maintain these values for you.
