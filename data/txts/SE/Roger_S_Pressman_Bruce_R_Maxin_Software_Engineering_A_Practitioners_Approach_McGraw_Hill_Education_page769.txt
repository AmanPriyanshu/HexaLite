proximately $1,230. Based on the FP estimate and the historical productivity 
data, the total estimated project cost is $461,000 and the estimated effort is 58 
person-months.

Process-Based Estimation 
 
The most common technique for estimating a project is to base the estimate on the process that will be used. That is, the process is decomposed into a relatively 
small set of activities, actions, and tasks and the effort required to accomplish 
each is estimated.  Like the problem-based techniques, process-based estimation begins with a delineation of software functions obtained from the project scope. A series of 
framework activities must be performed for each function. Functions and related 
framework activities  8 
 
 may be represented as part of a table similar to the one 
presented in   
Figure 33.4  
.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Once problem functions and process activities are melded, you estimate the effort (e.g., person-months) that will be required to accomplish each software 
process activity for each software function. These data constitute the central ma-
trix of the table in   
Figure 33.4  
. Average labor rates (i.e., cost/unit effort) are then 
applied to the effort estimated for each process activity. 
 If process-based estimation is performed independently of LOC or FP es-timation, you now have two or three estimates for cost and effort that may be    If time permits, use 
Ô¨Å ner granularity when 

specifying tasks in 
  Figure 33.4  . For ex-

ample, break analysis 
into its major tasks 
and estimate each 
separately.

discussed in Chapter 3. They are: customer communication (CC), planning, risk analysis, engi-
neering, and construction/release. pre22126_ch33_727-753.indd   739pre22126_ch33_727-753.indd   73913/12/13   6:17 PM13/12/13   6:17 PM
