QUALITY MANAGEMENT 
 
 
  P
ROBLEMS AND POINTS TO PONDER  
 
 
 
26.1.  Are there any situations in which MobileApp testing on actual devices can be disregarded?    
 
26.2.  In your own words, discuss the objectives for testing a MobileApp.    
 
26.3.  Compatibility is an important quality dimension. What must be tested to ensure that compatibility exists for a MobileApp?    
 
26.4.  Locate a free MobileApp testing tool. Critique the performance of the tool relative to the MobileApp with which you are familiar. 
   
 
26.5.  What elements of the MobileApp can be “unit tested”? What types of tests must be conducted only after the MobileApp elements are integrated?    
 
26.6.  Is it always necessary to develop a formal written-test plan? Explain.    
 
26.7.  Is it fair to say that the overall MobileApp-testing strategy begins with user-visible 
elements and moves toward technology elements? Are there exceptions to this strategy?    
 
26.8.  Is certiﬁ cation testing  
really
 
 testing in a conventional sense? Explain.    
 
26.9.  Describe the steps associated with user experience testing for a MobileApp.    
 
26.10.  Assume that you are developing a MobileApp to access an online pharmacy that  caters to senior citizens. The pharmacy provides typical functions, but also maintains a 
 database for each customer so that it can provide drug information and warn of potential 
drug interactions. Discuss any special usability tests for this MobileApp. 
   
 
26.11.  Assume that you have implemented a Web service that provides a drug interaction–
checking function for  YourCornerPharmacy.com
 
 (see Problem 26.10). Discuss the types of 
component-level tests that would have to be conducted on the mobile device to ensure that 
the MobileApp accesses this function properly. 
   
 
26.12.  How can a MobileApp’s ability to take context into account be tested? 
   
 
26.13.  Is it possible to test every conﬁ guration that a MobileApp is likely to encounter in the 
production environment? If it is not, how do you select a meaningful set of conﬁ guration 
tests?    
 
26.14.  Describe a security test that might need to be conducted for the   
 
YourCornerPhar-
macy  (Problem 26.10) MobileApp. Who should perform this test?    
 
26.15.  What is the difference between stress-testing a MobileApp and stress-testing a WebApp?

 READINGS AND INFORMATION
 SOURCES  
 
There are many books that describe mobile computing and these often contain discus-sions of MobileApp testing. Kumar and Xie ( Handbook of Mobile Systems Applications and Services, 
 Auerbach Publications, 2012) have edited a book that covers mobile ser-
vices and the role of service-oriented architectures in mobile computing. Books on per-

vasive computing by Chalmers ( Sensing and Systems in Pervasive Computing: Engineering Context Aware Systems
 
 Springer, 2011)), Adelstein ( 
Fundamentals of Mobile and Pervasive Computing 
, McGraw-Hill, 2004  
) and Hansmann ( Pervasive Computing: The Mobile World
 
, 2nd ed., Springer, 2003) deﬁ
 ne the principles of context in mobile computing. The book by 
Nguyen, et al. ( Testing Applications on the Web: Test Planning for Mobile and Internet-Based 
Systems, 
 2nd ed., Wiley, 2003) discusses testing of MobileApps with an emphasis on testing 
accessibility, reliability, and security.
