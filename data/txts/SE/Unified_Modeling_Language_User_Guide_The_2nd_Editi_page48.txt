 Terms and Concepts A class is a description of a set of objects that share the same attributes, operations, relationships, and semantics. Graphically, a class is rendered as a rectangle. Names A class name must be unique within its enclosingpackage, as discussed in Chapter 12. Every class must have a name that distinguishes it from other classes. A name is a textual string. That name alone is known as a simple name; a path name is the class name prefixed by the name of the package in which that class lives. A class may be drawn showing only its name, as Figure 4-2 shows. Figure 4-2 Simple and Path Names  Note A class name may be text consisting of any number of letters, numbers, and certain punctuation marks (except for marks such as the colon, which is used to separate a class name and the name of its enclosing package) and may continue over several lines. In practice, class names are short nouns or noun phrases drawn from the vocabulary of the system you are modeling. Typically, you capitalize the first letter of every word in a class name, as in Customer or TemperatureSensor.
