THREE  QUALITY MANAGEMENTHowever, Ivory and her colleagues [Ivo01] propose a set of measures that may be 

useful in assessing the impact of aesthetic design:Suggested MetricDescriptionWord countTotal number of words that appear on a page

Body text percentagePercentage of words that are body versus display text (e.g., headers)

Emphasized body text percentagePor
tion of body text that is emphasized (e.g., bold, capitalized)Text positioning countChanges in text position from flush left

Text cluster countText areas highlighted with color, bordered regions, rules, or lists

Link countTotal links on a page

Page sizeTotal bytes for the page as well as elements, graphics, and style 
sheetsGraphic percentagePercentage of page bytes that are for graphics

Graphics countTotal graphics on a page (not including graphics specified in scripts, 
applets, and objects)Color countTotal colors employed
Font countTotal fonts employed (i.e., face 
1 size 1 bold 1 italic)     
Content metrics.   Metrics in this category focus on content complexity and on clusters of content objects that are organized into pages [Men01]. Suggested MetricDescriptionPage waitAverage time required for a page to download at different connection 
speedsPage complexityAverage number of different types of media used on page, not 
including textGraphic complexityAverage number of graphics media per page

Audio complexityAverage number of audio media per page

Video complexityAverage number of video media per page

Animation complexityAverage number of animations per page
Scanned image complexityAverage number of scanned images per page
     
Navigation metrics.   Metrics in this category address the complexity of the navi-gational ﬂ ow [Men01]. In general, they are applicable only for static Web applica-
tions, which don’t include dynamically generated links and pages. Suggested MetricDescriptionPage-linking complexity Number of links per page

Connectivity Total number of internal links, not including dynamically generated linksConnectivity densityConnectivity divided by page count
