CHAPTER 13  
ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN 261 
 
 
Object-Oriented Architectures.   The components of a system encapsulate data and the operations that must be applied to manipulate the data. Communication 
and coordination between components are accomplished via message passing.   
 
Layered Architectures.   The basic structure of a layered architecture is illus-trated in  Figure 13.4 . A number of different layers are deﬁ ned, each accomplish-
ing operations that progressively become closer to the machine instruction set. 
At the outer layer, components service user interface operations. At the inner 

layer, components perform operating system interfacing. Intermediate layers 

provide utility services and application software functions.   
These architectural styles are only a small subset of those available.  2 
 
 Once re-
quirements engineering uncovers the characteristics and constraints of the sys-
tem to be built, the architectural style and/or combination of patterns that best 
ﬁ ts those characteristics and constraints can be chosen. In many cases, more 
than one pattern might be appropriate and alternative architectural styles can 
be designed and evaluated. For example, a layered style (appropriate for most 
systems) can be combined with a data-centered architecture in many database 
applications.   
 
 
 
 
 
Choosing the right architecture style can be tricky. Buschman [Bus10a] sug-
gests two complementary concepts that can provide some guidance.  Problem 
frames 
 describe characteristics of recurring problems, without being distracted 
by references to details of domain knowledge or programming solution imple-
mentations.  Domain-driven design 
 suggests that the software design should
