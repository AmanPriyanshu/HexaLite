THE SCM REPOSITORY  
 
The SCM repository is the set of mechanisms and data structures that allow a 
software team to manage change in an effective manner. It provides the obvious 

functions of a modern database management system by ensuring data integrity, 

sharing, and integration. In addition, the SCM repository provides a hub for 

the integration of software tools, is central to the ﬂ ow of the software process, 
and can enforce uniform structure and format for software engineering work 

products. 
 To achieve these capabilities, the repository is deﬁ
 ned in terms of a me-
ta-model. The  meta-model 
 determines how information is stored in the repos-
itory, how data can be accessed by tools and viewed by software engineers, how 

well data security and integrity can be maintained, and how easily the existing 
model can be extended to accommodate new needs.

General Features and Content 
 
The features and content of the repository are best understood by looking at it from two perspectives: what is to be stored in the repository and what speciﬁ c 
services are provided by the repository. A detailed breakdown of types of repre-

sentations, documents, and other work products that are stored in the repository 
is presented in  Figure 29.3
