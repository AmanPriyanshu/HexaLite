CHAPTER 22  
SOFTWARE TESTING STRATEGIES
 495O'Brien ( Agile Testing with Ruby and Rails,
 
 Apress, 2008) addresses testing strategies and 
techniques for the Ruby programming language and Web framework. 
  
 
Bashir and Goel ( Testing Object-Oriented Software,
 
 Springer-Verlag, 2012), Sykes and 
McGregor ( Practical Guide to Testing Object-Oriented Software,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 2001), 
Binder ( Testing Object-Oriented Systems,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 1999), Kung and his colleagues 
( Testing Object-Oriented Software,
 
 IEEE Computer Society Press, 1998), and Marick ( 
The Craft of Software Testing,
 
 Prentice Hall, 1997) present strategies and methods for testing 
OO systems.   
 
Guidelines for debugging are contained in books by Grötker and his colleagues ( The Developer's Guide to Debugging, 
 2nd ed., CreateSpace Independent Publishing, 2012), Whit-
taker ( Exploratory Testing,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 2009), Zeller ( 
Why Programs Fail: A Guide to 
Systematic Debugging, 
 2nd ed., Morgan Kaufmann, 2009), Butcher ( 
Debug I!, 
 Pragmatic 
Bookshelf, 2009), Agans ( Debugging, 
 Amacon, 2006), and Tells and Hsieh ( 
The Science of Debugging, 
 The Coreolis Group, 2001). Kaspersky ( 
Hacker Debugging Uncovered,
 
 A-List 
Publishing, 2005) addresses the technology of debugging tools. Younessi ( 
Object-Oriented Defect Management of Software,
 
 Prentice Hall, 2002) presents techniques for managing de-
fects that are encountered in object-oriented systems. Beizer [Bei84] presents an interest-
ing “taxonomy of bugs” that can lead to effective methods for test planning.   
 
Books by Graham and Fewster ( Experiences of Test Automation,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 2012) 
and Dustin and his colleagues ( Implementing Automated Software Testing
 
, Addison-Wesley, 
2009) discuss automated testing. Books by Hunt and John ( Java Performance, 
 Addison-Wes-
ley, 2011), Hewardt and his colleagues ( 
Advanced .NET Debugging, 
 Addison-Wesley, 2009), 
Matloff and his colleagues ( The Art of Debugging with GDB, DDD, and Eclipse, 
 No Starch 
Press, 2008), Madisetti and Akgul ( Debugging Embedded Systems, 
 Springer, 2007), Robbins 
( Debugging Microsoft .NET 2.0 Applications,
 
 Microsoft Press, 2005), Best ( 
Linux Debugging and Performance Tuning,
 
 Prentice Hall, 2005), Ford and Teorey ( 
Practical Debugging in C++, 
 Prentice Hall, 2002), Brown ( Debugging Perl, 
 McGraw-Hill, 2000), and Mitchell ( 
Debugging Java, 
 McGraw-Hill, 2000) address the special nature of debugging for the environments im-plied by their titles.   
 
A wide variety of information sources on software testing strategies are available on the Internet. An up-to-date list of World Wide Web references that are relevant to software test-

ing strategies can be found at the SEPA website:
