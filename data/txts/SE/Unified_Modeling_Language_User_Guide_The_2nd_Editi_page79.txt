$ documentation  Specifies a comment, description, or explanation of the element to which it is attached You'll use this tagged value when you want to attach a comment directly to the specification of an element, such as a class. Common Modeling Techniques Modeling Comments The most common purpose for which you'll use notes is to write down free-form observations, reviews, or explanations. By putting these comments directly in your models, your models can become a common repository for all the disparate artifacts you'll create during development. You can even use notes to visualize requirements and show how they tie explicitly to the parts of your model. To model a comment, 路 Put your comment as text in a note and place it adjacent to the element to which it refers. You can show a more explicit relationship by connecting a note to its elements using a dependency relationship. 路 Remember that you can hide or make visible the elements of your model as you see fit. This means that you don't have to make your comments visible everywhere the elements to which it is attached are visible. Rather, expose your comments in your diagrams only insofar as you need to communicate that information in that context. 路 If your comment is lengthy or involves something richer than plain text, consider putting your comment in an external document and linking or embedding that document in a note attached to your model. 路 As your model evolves, keep those comments that record significant decisions that cannot be inferred from the model itself, and#unless they are of historic interest#discard the others. Simplegeneralization is discussed in Chapter 5; advanced forms of generalization are discussed in Chapter 10. For example, Figure 6-8 shows a model that's a work in progress of a class hierarchy, showing some requirements that shape the model, as well as some notes from a design review.
