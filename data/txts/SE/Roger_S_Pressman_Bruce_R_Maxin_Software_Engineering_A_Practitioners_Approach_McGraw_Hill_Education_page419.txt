ROBLEMS AND POINTS TO PONDER  
 
 
 
17.1.  Why is the “artistic ideal” an insufﬁ cient design philosophy when modern WebApps 
are built? Is there ever a case in which the artistic ideal is the philosophy to follow?    
 
17.2.  In this chapter we select a broad array of quality attributes for WebApps. Select the 
three that you believe are most important, and make an argument that explains why each 
should be emphasized in WebApp design work. 
   
 
17.3.  Add at least ﬁ ve additional questions to the WebApp Design—Quality Checklist pre-
sented in Section 17.1.    
 
17.4.  You are a WebApp designer for FutureLearning Corporation, a distance learning com-
pany. You intend to implement an Internet-based “learning engine” that will enable you to 

deliver course content to a student. The learning engine provides the basic infrastructure 
for delivering learning content on any subject (content designers will prepare appropriate 
content). Develop a prototype interface design for the learning engine.    
 
17.5.  What is the most aesthetically pleasing website you have ever visited and why?    
 
17.6.  Consider the content object  Order,
 
 generated once a user of  
 
SafeHomeAssured.com 
 
 has completed the selection of all components and is ready to ﬁ nalize his purchase. Develop 
a UML description for  Order 
 along with all appropriate design representations.    
 
17.7.  What is the difference between content architecture and WebApp architecture? 
   
 
17.8.  Reconsidering the FutureLearning “learning engine” described in Problem 17.4, select a content architecture that would be appropriate for the WebApp. Discuss why you made 

the choice.    
 
17.9.  Use UML to develop three or four design representations for content objects that would be encountered while the “learning engine” described in Problem 17.4 is designed.    
 
17.10.  Do a bit of additional research on the MVC architecture and decide whether it would be an appropriate WebApp architecture for the “learning engine” discussed in Problem 17.4. 
   
 
17.11.  What is the difference between navigation syntax and navigation semantics?    
 
17.12.  Deﬁ ne two or three NSUs for the  
 
SafeHomeAssured.com 
 
 WebApp. Describe each in 
some detail.

Van Duyne and his colleagues ( 
The Design of Sites, 
 2nd ed., Prentice Hall, 2007) have writ-
ten a comprehensive book that covers most important aspects of the WebApp design pro-

cess. Design process models and design patterns are covered in detail. Johnson ( Designing with the Mind in Mind: Simple Guide to Understanding User Interface Design Rules, 
 Morgan 
Kaufman, 2010) has written a book on user interaction design with many examples appli-
cable to web design. Wodtke and Gavella ( 
Information Architecture: Blueprints for the Web,
 
 2nd ed., New Riders Publishing, 2009), Rosenfeld and Morville ( Information Architecture for 
the World Wide Web,
 
 3rd ed., 
 
 O’Reilly & Associates, 2006), and Reiss ( 
Practical Information Architecture,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 2000) address content architecture and other topics. 
  
 
Although hundreds of books have been written on “Web design,” very few of these dis-
