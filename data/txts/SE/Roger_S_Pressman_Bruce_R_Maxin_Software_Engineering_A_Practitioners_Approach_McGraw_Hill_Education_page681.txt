ROBLEMS AND POINTS TO PONDER  
 
 
 
29.1.  Why is the First Law of System Engineering true? Provide speciﬁ c examples for each 
of the four fundamental reasons for change.    
 
29.2.  What are the four elements that exist when an effective SCM system is implemented? Discuss each brieﬂ y. 
   
 
29.3.  Discuss the reasons for baselines in your own words.    
 
29.4.  Assume that you’re the manager of a small project. What baselines would you deﬁ ne 
for the project and how would you control them?    
 
29.5.  Design a project database (repository) system that would enable a software engineer to store, cross-reference, trace, update, change, and so forth all important software con-
ﬁ guration items. How would the database handle different versions of the same program? 
Would source code be handled differently than documentation? How will two developers be 

precluded from making different changes to the same SCI at the same time?    
 
29.6.  Research an existing SCM tool and describe how it implements control for versions, variants, and conﬁ guration objects in general. 
   
 
29.7.  The relations <part-of> and <interrelated> represent simple relationships between conﬁ guration objects. Describe ﬁ
 ve additional relationships that might be useful in the con-
text of an SCM repository. 
   
 
29.8.  Research an existing SCM tool and describe how it implements the mechanics of ver-
sion control. Alternatively, read two or three papers on SCM and describe the different data 

structures and referencing mechanisms that are used for version control.    
 
29.9.  Develop a checklist for use during conﬁ guration audits. 
   
 
29.10.  What is the difference between an SCM audit and a technical review? Can their func-tion be folded into one review? What are the pros and cons?    
 
29.11.  Brieﬂ y describe the differences between SCM for conventional software and SCM for 
Web or MobileApps. 
   
 
29.12.  What is content management? Use the Web to research the features of a content 
management tool and provide a brief summary.
