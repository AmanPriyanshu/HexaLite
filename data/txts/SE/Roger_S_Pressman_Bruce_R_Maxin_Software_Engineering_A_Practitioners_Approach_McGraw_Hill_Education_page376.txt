MODELING 
 
 
15.13.  Develop an approach that would automatically integrate error messages and a user help facility. That is, the system would automatically recognize the error type and provide 

a help window with suggestions for correcting it. Perform a reasonably complete software 
design that considers appropriate data structures and algorithms.    
 
15.14.  Develop an interface evaluation questionnaire that contains 20 generic questions that would apply to most interfaces. Have 10 classmates complete the questionnaire for an 
interactive system that you all use. Summarize the results and report them to your class.

 READINGS AND INFORMATION

Although his book is not speciﬁ cally about human-computer interfaces, much of what 
 Donald Norman ( The Design of Everyday Things, 
 reissue edition, Basic Books, 2002) has to 
say about the psychology of effective design applies to the user interface. It is recommended 
reading for anyone who is serious about doing high-quality interface design. Weinschenk 

( 100 Things Every Designer Should Know About People, 
 New Riders, 2011) does not speciﬁ
 -cally focus on software but presents insightful discussion of user-centered design. Johnson 

( Designing with the Mind in Mind, 
 Morgan Kaughman, 2010) uses cognitive psychology to 
develop rules for the design of effective interfaces.   
 
Graphical user interfaces are ubiquitous in the modern world of computing. Whether it’s 
an ATM, a mobile phone, an electronic dashboard in an automobile, a website, or a business 

application, the user interface provides a window into the software. It is for this reason that 
books addressing interface design abound. Among many that are worth considering are:   
 
Ballard  (Designing the Mobile User Experience, 
 Wiley, 2007). 
  
 
Butow ( User Interface Design for Mere Mortals,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 2007). 
  
 
Cooper and his colleagues ( About Face 3: The Essentials of Interaction Design, 
 3rd ed., 
Wiley, 2007). 
  
 
Galitz ( The Essential Guide to User Interface Design, 
 3rd ed., Wiley, 2007). 
  
 
Goodwin and Cooper ( Designing for the Digital Age: How to Create Human-Centered 
Products and Services
 
, Wiley, 2009). 
  
 
Hartson and Pyla ( The UX Book: Process and Guidelines for Ensuring a Quality User 
Experience 
, Morgan Kaufman, 2012).   
 
Lehikonen and colleagues ( Personal Content Experience: Managing Digital Life in the Mobile Age, 
 Wiley-Interscience, 2007). 
  
 
Nielsen ( Coordinating User Interfaces for Consistency,
 
 Morgan-Kaufmann, 2006).   
 
Pratt and Nunes ( Interactive Design, 
 Rockport, 2013).   
 
Rogers and colleagues ( Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction 
, iley, 2011). 
  
 
Shneiderman and colleagues ( Designing the User Interface: Strategies for Effective  Human-Computer Interaction 
, 5th ed., Addison-Wesley, 2009). 
  
 
Tidwell ( 
Designing Interfaces 
, O’Reilly Media, 2nd ed., 2011).   
 
Johnson ( GUI Bloopers: Common User Interface Design Don’ts and Do’s,
 
 2nd 
 ed.,
 
  Morgan-Kaufmann, 2007) and ( GUI Bloopers: Don’ts and Do’s for Software Developers and 
Web Designers,
 
 Morgan-Kaufmann, 2000) provides useful guidance for those that learn more 
effectively by examining counterexamples. An enjoyable book by Cooper ( The Inmates Are 
Running the Asylum, 
 Sams Publishing, 2004) discusses why high-tech products drive us 
crazy and how to design ones that don’t.   
 
A wide variety of information sources on user interface design are available on the  Internet. An up-to-date list of World Wide Web references that are relevant to user interface 
design can be found at the SEPA website:
