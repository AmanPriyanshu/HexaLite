 Terms and Concepts An activity diagram shows the flow from activity to activity. An is an ongoing nonatomic execution within a state machine. Activities ultimately result in some action, which is made up of executable atomic computations that result in a change in state of the system or the return of a value. Actions encompass calling another operation, sending a signal, creating or destroying an object, or some pure computation, such as evaluating an expression. Graphically, an activity diagram is a collection of vertices and arcs. Common Properties The general properties of diagrams are discussed in Chapter 7. An activity diagram is just a special kind of diagram and shares the same common properties as do all other diagrams#a name and graphical contents that are a projection into a model. What distinguishes an interaction diagram from all other kinds of diagrams is its content. Contents States, transitions, and state machines are discussed in Chapter 21; objects are discussed in Chapter 13. Activity diagrams commonly contain
