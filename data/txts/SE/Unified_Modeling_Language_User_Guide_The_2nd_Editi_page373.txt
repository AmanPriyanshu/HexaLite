composition of these structural and behavioral elements into progressively larger subsystems, and the architectural style that guides this organization#these elements and their interfaces, their collaborations, and their composition. Software architecture is not only concerned with structure and behavior, but also with usage, functionality, performance, resilience, reuse, comprehensibility, economic and technology constraints and trade-offs, and aesthetic concerns.  architecture-centric  In the context of the software development life cycle, a process that focuses on the early development and baselining of a software architecture, then uses the system's architecture as a primary artifact for conceptualizing, constructing, managing, and evolving the system under development.  argument  A specific value corresponding to a parameter.  artifact  A piece of information that is used or produced by a software development process.  association  A structural relationship that describes a set of links, in which a link is a connection among objects; the semantic relationship between two or more classifiers that involves the connections among their instances.  association class  A modeling element that has both association and class properties. An association class can be seen as an association that also has class properties, or as a class that also has association properties.  association end  The endpoint of an association, which connects that association to a classifier.  asynchronous action  A request in which the sending object does not pause to wait for results.  attribute  A named property of a classifier that describes a range of values that instances of the property may hold.
