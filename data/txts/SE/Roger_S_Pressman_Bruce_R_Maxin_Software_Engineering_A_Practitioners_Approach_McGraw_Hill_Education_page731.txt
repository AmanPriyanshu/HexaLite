The Project Management Institute ( Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge,
 
 4th ed., PMI, 2009) covers all important aspects of project management. Wysocki ( 
Effective Software Project Management: Traditional, Agile, Extreme,
 
 6th ed., Wiley, 2011), Slinger and 
Broderick ( The Software Project Manager’s Bridge to Agility,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 2008), Bech-
told ( Essentials of Software Project Management,

( Making Things Happen: Mastering Project Management—Theory in Practice,
 
 O’Reilly, 2008) 
teach basic skills and provide detailed guidance for all software project management tasks. 
McConnell ( Professional Software Development,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 2004) offers pragmatic 
advice for achieving “shorter schedules, higher quality products, and more successful proj-
ects.” Henry ( Software Project Management,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 2003) offers real-world advice 
that is useful for all project managers.   
 
Tom DeMarco and his colleagues ( 
Adrenaline Junkies and Template Zombies,
 
 Dorset 
House, 2008) have written an insightful treatment of the human patterns that are encoun-
tered in every software project. An excellent four-volume series written by Weinberg ( 
Qual-ity Software Management,
 
 Dorset House, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996) introduces basic systems 
thinking and management concepts, explains how to use measurements effectively, and 

addresses “congruent action,” the ability to establish “ﬁ t” between the manager’s needs, 
the needs of technical staff, and the needs of the business. It will provide both new and 
experienced managers with useful information. Futrell and his colleagues ( Quality Soft-ware Project Management,
 
 Prentice Hall, 2002) present a voluminous treatment of project 
management. Books by Neill and his colleagues ( Antipatterns: Managing Software Organi-
zations, 
 2nd ed., Auerbach Publications, 2011) and Brown and his colleagues ( 
Antipatterns in Project Management,
 
 Wiley, 2000) discuss what not to do during the management of a 
software project.   
 
Brooks ( The Mythical Man-Month, 
 Anniversary Edition, Addison-Wesley, 1995) has up-
dated his classic book to provide new insight into software project and management is-
sues. McConnell ( Software Project Survival Guide,
 
 Microsoft Press, 1997) presents excellent pragmatic guidance for those who must manage software projects. Purba and Shah ( How to pre22126_ch31_683-702.indd   701pre22126_ch31_683-702.indd   70113/12/13   6:16 PM13/12/13   6:16 PM
