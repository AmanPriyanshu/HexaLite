The goal of MobileApp testing is to exercise each of the many dimensions of  MobileApp quality with the intent of ﬁ nding errors or uncovering issues that 
may lead to quality failures. Testing focuses on quality elements such as content, 

 function, structure, usability, use of context, navigability, performance, power 
management, compatibility, interoperability, capacity, and security. It incorpo-

rates reviews and usability assessments that occur as the MobileApp is designed, 
and tests that are conducted once the MobileApp has been implemented and 
deployed on an actual device.  The MobileApp testing strategy exercises each quality dimension by initially examining “units” of content, functionality, or navigation. Once individual units 

have been validated, the focus shifts to tests that exercise the MobileApp as a 
whole. To accomplish this, many tests are derived from the user’s perspective 

and are driven by information contained in use cases. A MobileApp test plan 
is developed and identiﬁ es testing steps, work products (e.g., test cases), and 
mechanisms for the evaluation of test results. The testing process encompasses 
several different types of testing.  Content testing (and reviews) focus on various categories of content. The in-tent is to examine errors that affect the presentation of the content to the end 
user. The content needs to be examined for performance issues imposed by the 

mobile device constraints. Interface testin g 
 exercises the interaction mecha-
nisms that deﬁ ne the user experience provided by the MobileApp. The intent is 
to uncover errors that result when the MobileApp does not take device, user, or 

location context into account.  Navigation testing is based on use cases, derived as part of the modeling activity. The test cases are designed to exercise each usage scenario against 

the navigation design within architectural framework used to deploy the Mo-
bileApp. Component testing exercises content and functional units within the 
MobileApp.  Conﬁ guration testing attempts to uncover errors and/or compatibility prob-
lems that are speciﬁ c to a particular device or network environment. Tests are 
then conducted to uncover errors associated with each possible conﬁ guration. 
This is complicated by the large number of mobile devices and network service 
providers. Security testing incorporates a series of tests designed to exploit 
vulnerabilities in the MobileApp or its environment. The intent is to ﬁ nd secu-
rity holes in either the device operating environment or the Web services being 

accessed. Performance testing encompasses a series of tests that are designed 
to assess MobileApp response time and reliability as demands on server-side 

resource capacity increase. Finally, MobileApp testing should address perfor-

mance issues such as power usage, processing speed, memory limitations, ability 
to recover from failures, and connectivity issues. pre22126_ch26_567-583.indd   581pre22126_ch26_567-583.indd   58113/12/13   6:15 PM13/12/13   6:15 PM
