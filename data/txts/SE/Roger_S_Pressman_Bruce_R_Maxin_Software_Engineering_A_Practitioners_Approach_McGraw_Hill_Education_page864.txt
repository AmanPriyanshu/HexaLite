individual or team level. Both PSP and TSP (Chapter 4 emphasize the need to continuously collect data about the work that is being performed and to use that 
data to develop strategies for improvement. Watts Humphrey, (Hum97], [Hum00]) 

the developer of both methods, comments:  
The PSP [and TSP] will show you how to plan and track your work and how to consis-tently produce high quality software. Using PSP [and TSP] will give you the data that 
.o 
have a successful and rewarding career, you need to know your skills and abilities, 

strive to improve them, and capitalize on your unique talents in the work you do.  
 
 
  
 
 
 
TickIT.   
The Ticket auditing method [Tic05] ensures compliance with  
ISO 9001:2000 
for Software
 
 
— 
a generic standard that applies to any organization that wants to im-prove the overall quality of the products, systems, or services that it provides. There-
fore, the standard is directly applicable to software organizations and companies. 
 The underlying strategy suggested by ISO 9001:2000 is described in the follow-ing manner [ISO00]:  
ISO 9001:2000 stresses the importance for an organization to identify, implement, 
manage and continually improve the effectiveness of the processes that are neces-
sary for the quality management system, and to manage the interactions of these 
processes in order to achieve the organization’
...Process effectiveness 
and efﬁ ciency can be assessed through internal or external review processes and be 
evaluated on a maturity scale.  
 
 
 
 
  
 
ISO 9001:2008 has adopted a “plan-do-check-act” cycle that is applied to the qual-ity management elements of a software project. Within a software context, “plan” 

establishes the process objectives, activities, and tasks necessary to achieve 
high-quality software and resultant customer satisfaction. “Do” implements the 
software process (including both framework and umbrella activities). “Check” 
monitors and measures the process to ensure that all requirements established 
for quality management have been achieved. “Act” initiates software process im-
provement activities that continually work to improve the process. TickIt can 

be used throughout the “plan-do-check-act” cycle to ensure that SPI progress is 
being made. TickIT auditors assess the application of the cycle as a precursor to 

ISO 9001:2008 certiﬁ cation. For a detailed discussion of ISO 9001:2008 and TickIT 
you should examine [Ant06], [Tri05], or [Sch03].

SPI RETURN ON INVESTMENT  
 
SPI is hard work and requires substantial investment of dollars and people. Man-agers who approve the budget and resources for SPI will invariably ask the ques-
tion: “How do I know that we’ll achieve a reasonable return for the money we’re 
spending?”   uote:  “Software 
organizations 
have exhibited 
signiﬁ cant 

shortcomings in 
their ability to 
capitalize on the 
experiences gained 
from completed 
projects.”  NASA
