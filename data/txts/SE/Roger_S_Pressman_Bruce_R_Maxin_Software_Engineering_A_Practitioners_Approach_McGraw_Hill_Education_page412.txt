MODELING 
 
 
Grid structures
 
 ( 
Figure 17.5 ) are an architectural option that you can apply when WebApp content can be organized categorically in two (or more) dimen-

sions. For example, consider a situation in which an e-commerce site sells golf 
clubs. The horizontal dimension of the grid represents the type of club to be sold 
(e.g., woods, irons, wedges, putters). The vertical dimension represents the offer-

ings provided by various golf club manufacturers. Hence, a user might navigate 
the grid horizontally to ﬁ nd the putters column and then vertically to examine 
the offerings provided by those manufacturers that sell putters. This WebApp 

architecture is useful only when highly regular content is encountered [Pow02].   
 
Hierarchical structures
 
 ( 
Figure 17.6 ) are undoubtedly the most common WebApp architecture. Unlike the partitioned software hierarchies discussed in 

Chapter 13 that encourage ﬂ ow of control only along vertical branches of the
