timing constraints that apply to both stimulus and response processing. These 

constraints are used to establish the deadlines for the processes in the system.4. Process design Process design involves aggregating the stimulus and response 
processing into a number of concurrent processes. A good starting point for 

designing the process architecture is the architectural patterns that I describe in 
Section 20.2. You then optimize the process architecture to reflect the specific 

requirements that you have to implement.5. Algorithm design 
For each stimulus and response, you design algorithms to 
carry out the required computations. Algorithm designs may have to be devel-
oped relatively early in the design process to indicate the amount of processing 
required and the time needed to complete that processing. This is especially 

important for computationally intensive tasks, such as signal processing.6. Data design 
You specify the information that is exchanged by processes and the 

events that coordinate information exchange, and design data structures to man-
age this information exchange. Several concurrent processes may share these 

data structures.7. Process scheduling 
You design a scheduling system that will ensure that pro
-
cesses are started in time to meet their deadlines.The specific activities and the activity sequence in a real-time system design pro
-cess depend on the type of system being developed, its novelty, and its environment.
