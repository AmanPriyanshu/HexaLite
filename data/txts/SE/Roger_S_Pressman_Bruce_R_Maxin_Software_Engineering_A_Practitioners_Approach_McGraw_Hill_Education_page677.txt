WebApps
  
 
Change Management   
 Objective: 
 To assist Web engineers and 
content developers in managing changes as they are made to WebApp conﬁ
 guration objects. 
  Mechanics: 
 Tools in this category were originally 
developed for conventional software but can be adapted 
for use by Web engineers and content developers to 

make controlled changes to WebApps. They support 

automated check-in and check-out, version control and 
rollback, reporting, and other SCM functions.
