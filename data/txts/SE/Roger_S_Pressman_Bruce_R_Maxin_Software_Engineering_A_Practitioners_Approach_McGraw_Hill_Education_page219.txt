CHAPTER 10  
REQUIREMENTS MODELING: CLASS-BASED METHODS 189 
To illustrate, we consider the 
 System
 
 class deﬁ
 ned for  
SafeHome. 
 A homeowner 
can conﬁ gure the security function to reﬂ
 ect sensor information, alarm response 
information, activation/deactivation information, identiﬁ cation information, and 
so forth. We can represent these composite data items in the following manner:
  
identiﬁ cation information 
5 system ID 1 veriﬁ cation phone number 
1 system status  alarm response information 5 delay time 1 telephone number  activation/deactivation information 5 master password 1 number of allowable tries 1 temporary password    Each of the data items to the right of the equal sign could be further deﬁ ned 
to an elementary level, but for our purposes, they constitute a reasonable list of 
attributes for the  System 
 class (shaded portion of  Figure 10.1 ).   Sensors are part of the overall  SafeHome 
 system, and yet they are not listed 
as data items or as attributes in  Figure 10.1 .  Sensor 
 has already been deﬁ
 ned as 
a class, and multiple  Sensor 
 objects will be associated with the  
System 
 class. In 
general, we avoid deﬁ ning an item as an attribute if more than one of the items 
is to be associated with the class.

OPERATIONS
    
 
 
Operations 
 deﬁ
 ne the behavior of an object. Although many different types of 
op-

erations that manipulate data in some way (e.g., adding, deleting, reformat-
ting, selecting), (2) operations that perform a computation, (3) operations that 
inquire about the state of an object, and (4) operations that monitor an object 
for the  occurrence of a controlling event. These functions are accomplished by Systemprogram( )display( )
