Readability 
—Is text well written and understandable?  9 
 
 Are graphic repre-sentations easy to understand?    
 
 
 
 
 
Aesthetics 
—Do layout, color, typeface, and related characteristics lead to 
ease of use? Do users “feel comfortable” with the look and feel of the WebApp? 
   
 
 
 
 
 
Display characteristics 
—Does the WebApp make optimal use of screen size 
and resolution?    
 
 
 
 
 
Time sensitivity
 
—Can important features, functions, and content be used or acquired in a timely manner?    
 
 
 
 
 
Personalization 
—Does the WebApp tailor itself to the speciﬁ
 c needs of differ-
ent user categories or individual users?    
 
 
 
 
 
Accessibility 
—Is the WebApp accessible to people who have disabilities? 
   
 
 
 
 
A series of tests is designed within each of these categories. In some cases, the 
“test” may be a visual review of a Web page. In other cases interface semantics tests 

may be executed again, but in this instance usability concerns are paramount. 
   
As an example, we consider usability assessment for interaction and interface mechanisms. Constantine and Lockwood [Con99] suggest that the following list 
of interface features should be reviewed and tested for usability: animation, but-
tons, color, control, dialogue, ﬁ
 elds, forms, frames, graphics, labels, links, menus, 
messages, navigation, pages, selectors, text, and tool bars. As each feature is as-
sessed, it is graded on a qualitative scale by the users who are doing the testing. 
 Figure 25.3  depicts a possible set of assessment “grades” that can be selected by 
users. These grades are applied to each feature individually, to a complete Web 

page, or to the WebApp as a whole.
