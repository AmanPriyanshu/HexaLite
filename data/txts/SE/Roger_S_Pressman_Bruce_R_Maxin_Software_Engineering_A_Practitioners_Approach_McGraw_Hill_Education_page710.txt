  A system has 12 external inputs, 24 external outputs, ﬁ elds 30 different external que-
ries, manages 4 internal logical ﬁ les, and interfaces with 6 different legacy systems (6 EIFs). 

All of these data are of average complexity and the overall system is relatively simple. Com-
pute FP for the system.  

   30.4.
  Software for System X has 24 individual functional requirements and 14 nonfunctional requirements. What is the speciﬁ city of the requirements? The completeness?  

   
30.5.  A major information system has 1140 modules. There are 96 modules that perform 
control and coordination functions and 490 modules whose function depends on prior pro-
cessing. The system processes approximately 220 data objects that each have an average 

of three attributes. There are 140 unique database items and 90 different database seg-
ments. Finally, 600 modules have single entry and exit points. Compute the DSQI for this 

system. 
    30.6.
  A class  X  has 12 operations. Cyclomatic complexity has been computed for all oper-
ations in the OO system, and the average value of module complexity is 4. For class  X , the complexity for operations 1 to 12 is 5, 4, 3, 3, 6, 8, 2, 2, 5, 5, 4, 4, respectively. Compute the 

weighted methods per class.  

   30.7.
  Develop a software tool that will compute cyclomatic complexity for a programming language module. You may choose the language.  

   30.8.
  Develop a small software tool that will perform a Halstead analysis on programming language source code of your choosing.  

   30.9.
  A legacy system has 940 modules. The latest release required that 90 of these modules be changed. In addition, 40 new modules were added and 12 old modules were removed. 
Compute the software maturity index for the system.

 READINGS AND INFORMATION
 SOURCES   
There is a surprisingly large number of books dedicated to software metrics, although the 
majority focus on process and project metrics to the exclusion of product metrics. Jones 
and Bonsignour ( The Economics of Software Quality,
  Addison-Wesley, 2011), Lanza and her 
colleagues ( Object-Oriented Metrics in Practice,  Springer, 2010) and Jones ( 
Applied Software 
Measurement: Global Analysis of Productivity and Quality,
  McGraw-Hill, 2008) discuss OO metrics and their use for assessing the quality of a design. Genero ( Metrics for Software 
Conceptual Models,  Imperial College Press, 2005) and Ejiogu ( Software Metrics,
  BookSurge Publishing, 2005) present a wide variety of technical metrics for use cases, UML models, and 
other modeling representations. Hutcheson ( Software Testing Fundamentals: Methods and 
Metrics,  Wiley, 2003) presents a set of metrics for testing. Abran ( 
Software Metrics and Soft-
ware Metrology,
  Wiley-IEEE Computer Society, 2010), Kan ( 
Metrics and Models in Software 
Quality Engineering,  Addison-Wesley, 2nd ed., 2002), Fenton and Pﬂ
 eeger ( 
Software Metrics: 
A Rigorous and Practical Approach,
  Brooks-Cole Publishing, 1998), and Zuse [Zus97] have written thorough treatments of product metrics.    
Books by Card and Glass [Car90], Zuse [Zus90], Fenton [Fen91], Ejiogu [Eji91], Moeller and Paulish ( Software Metrics,
  Chapman and Hall, 1993), and Hetzel [Het93] all address product metrics in some detail. Oman and Pﬂ eeger ( 
Applying Software Metrics,
  IEEE Computer So-ciety Press, 1997) have edited an anthology of important papers on software metrics.    
The International Function Point Users group has published a book on using function metrics ( The IFPUG Guide or OT and Software Measurement,
  Auerbach Publications, 2012). Methods for establishing a metrics program and the underlying principles for software 
measurement are considered by Ebert and his colleagues ( Best Practices in Software Mea-
surement,
  Springer, 2004). Shepperd ( 
Foundations of Software Measurement,
  Prentice Hall, 1996) also addresses measurement theory in some detail. Current research is presented in 
the  Proceedings of the Symposium on Software Metrics
  (IEEE, published annually).
