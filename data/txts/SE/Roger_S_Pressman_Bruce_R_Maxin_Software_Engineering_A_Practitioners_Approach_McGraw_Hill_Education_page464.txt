QUALITY MANAGEMENTexist. The relative costs associated with the discovery and correction of errors, overall cost (with and without review for our hypothetical example) can be es-
tablished. The number of errors uncovered during each of the steps noted in 
20.2 and 20.3 is multiplied by the cost to remove an error (1.5 cost units 

for design, 6.5 cost units before test, 15 cost units during test, and 67 cost units 
after release).  2 
 
 
 Using these data, the total cost for development and maintenance 
when reviews are conducted is 783 cost units. When no reviews are conducted, 
total cost is 2177 units—nearly three times more costly.

current. However, they serve to illustrate the costs of defect ampliﬁ
 cation nicely.
