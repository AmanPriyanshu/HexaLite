CHAPTER 17  
WEBAPP DESIGN 383hierarchy, a WebApp hierarchical structure can be designed in a manner that 
enables (via hypertext branching) ﬂ ow of control horizontally, across vertical 
branches of the structure. Hence, content presented on the far left-hand branch 
of the hierarchy can have hypertext links that lead directly to content that exists 
in the middle or right-hand branch of the structure. It should be noted, however, 

that although such branching allows rapid navigation across WebApp content, it 

can lead to confusion on the part of the user. 
  A  networked 
 or  
“pure web” structure
 
 ( 
Figure 17.7 ) is similar in many ways to the architecture that evolves for object-oriented systems. Architectural compo-
nents (in this case, Web pages) are designed so that they may pass control (via 

hypertext links) to virtually every other component in the system. This approach 
allows considerable navigation ﬂ exibility, but at the same time, can be confusing 
to a user.
