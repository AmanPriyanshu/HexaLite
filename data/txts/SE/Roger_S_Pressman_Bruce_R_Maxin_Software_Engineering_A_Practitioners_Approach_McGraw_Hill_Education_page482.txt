SQA PROCESSES AND PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS  
 
As we begin a discussion of software quality assurance, it’s important to note 
that SQA procedures and approaches that work in one software environment 
may not work as well in another. Even within a company that adopts a consis-

tent approach  2 
 
 to software engineering, different software products may exhibit 
different levels of quality [Par11].   The solution to this dilemma is to understand the speciﬁ c quality requirements 
for a software product and then select the process and speciﬁ c SQA actions and 
tasks that will be used to meet those requirements. The Software Engineering 
Institute’s CMMI and ISO 9000 standards are the most commonly used process 

frameworks. Each proposes “a syntax and semantics” [Par11] that will lead to the 
implementation of software engineering practices that improve product quality. 

Rather than instantiating either framework in its entirety, a software organiza-

tion can “harmonize” the two models by selecting elements of both frameworks 
and matching them to the quality requirements of an individual product.

SQA TASKS, GOALS, AND METRICS  
 
Software quality assurance is composed of a variety of tasks associated with two different constituencies—the software engineers who do technical work and
