To illustrate how decisions on development technologies influence security, 
assume that the health care provider has decided to build a Mentcare system using an off-the-shelf information system for maintaining patient records. This system has to 
be configured for each type of clinic in which it is used. This decision has been made 
because it appears to offer the most extensive functionality for the lowest develop-
ment cost and fastest deployment time.When you develop an application by reusing an existing system, you have to 
accept the design decisions made by the developers of that system. Let us assume 

that some of these design decisions are:1. System users are authenticated using a login name/password combination. No other authentication method is supported.2. The system architecture is clientŒserver, with clients accessing data through a 
standard web browser on a client computer.3.
 Information is presented to users as an editable web form. They can change 

information in place and upload the revised information to the server.For a generic system, these design decisions are perfectly acceptable, but design 
risk assessment shows that they have associated vulnerabilities. Examples of these 
possible vulnerabilities are shown in Figure 13.12.Once vulnerabilities have been identified, you then have to decide what steps you 
can take to reduce the associated risks. This will often involve making decisions
