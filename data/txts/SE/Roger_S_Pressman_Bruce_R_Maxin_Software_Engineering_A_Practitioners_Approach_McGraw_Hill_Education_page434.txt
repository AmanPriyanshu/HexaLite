404 PART TWO  
MODELING 
 
 
•   
Third-party SDK integration 
. Each network or cloud service is likely to require the use of a speciﬁ c API or SDK. It is easier to continue working in 
the one IDE, rather than several.   
 
 
•   
Post-compilation tools 
. An effective MIDE contains tools that allow the source code for a completed app to be optimized for a speciﬁ c mobile 
 device or service.   
 
 
•   
Over-the-air deployment support
 
. A good MIDE should allow the testing of the deployed app within the development environment. This can be tricky 
when the MobileApp needs to access Web services or other applications. 
  
 
 
•   
End-to-end mobile application development 
. Mobile devices are often not powerful enough to process or store large amounts of information locally. 

It is important to allow developers to create, test, and deploy entire mo-
bile projects using a desktop MIDE.   
 
 
•   
Documentation and tutorials 
. Even free development tools need to be easy to learn and easy to use. Having adequate support materials is essential.   
 
 
•   
Graphical user interface builders 
. If the MIDE supports visual construc-tion of user screens, prototypes can be constructed and tested quickly. 
 
 
  As we have already noted, it is difﬁ cult to design and implement one 
 MobileApp that runs seamlessly on multiple platforms. This is especially true for  
 
MobileApp Development Tools 
 
Many of the tools to develop MobileApps for popular devices are available as free down-loads from the World Wide Web:
