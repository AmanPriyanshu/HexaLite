CHAPTER 33  
ESTIMATION FOR SOFTWARE PROJECTS
 731 
Putnam and Myers [Put97a] suggest that scoping is not enough. Once scope is understood, you must work to determine if it can be accomplished within the 
dimensions of available technology, dollars, time, and resources. This is a crucial, 

although often overlooked, part of the estimation process.

RESOURCES  
 
The second planning task is estimation of the resources required to accomplish the software development effort.   
Figure 33.1  
 depicts the three major categories 
of software engineering resources—people, reusable software components, and 
the development environment (hardware and software tools). Each resource is 
speciﬁ ed with four characteristics: description of the resource, a statement of 
availability, time when the resource will be required, and duration of time that 

the resource will be applied. The last two characteristics can be viewed as a  time window 
. Availability of the resource for a speciﬁ
 ed window must be established 
at the earliest practical time.

Human Resources 
 
The planner begins by evaluating software scope and selecting the skills re-quired to complete development. Both organizational position (e.g., manager, 

senior software engineer) and specialty (e.g., telecommunications, database, 
client-server) are speciﬁ ed. For relatively small projects (a few person-months),
