 9.  Are the inputs, outputs, ﬁ les, or inquiries complex?  
   
 10.  Is the internal processing complex?  
   
 11.  Is the code designed to be reusable?  
   
 12.  Are conversion and installation included in the design?  
   
 13.  Is the system designed for multiple installations in different organizations?     
 14.  Is the application designed to facilitate change and ease of use by the 
user?  
  
Each of these questions is answered using an ordinal scale that ranges from 0 
(not important or applicable) to 5 (absolutely essential). The constant values in 
Equation (30.1) and the weighting factors that are applied to information domain 
counts are determined empirically. 
      
To illustrate the use of the FP metric in this context, consider a simple ﬂ
 ow diagram for a user interaction function within  SafeHome  software, represented in   Figure 30.2  . The function manages user interaction, accepting a user password to activate or deactivate the system, and allows inquiries on the status of security 
zones and various security sensors. The function displays a series of prompting 
messages and sends appropriate control signals to various components of the 
security system.  
 The ﬂ ow diagram is evaluated to determine a set of key information domain measures required for computation of the function point metric. Three external 
inputs— password, panic button,  and  activate/deactivate —are shown in the ﬁ g-ure along with two external inquiries— zone inquiry  and  sensor inquiry . One ILF ( system conﬁ guration ﬁ le
 ) is shown. Two external outputs ( 
messages  and  sensor  
 status ) and four EIFs ( test sensor, zone setting, activate/deactivate,
  and  alarm alert ) are also present. These data, along with the appropriate complexity, are 
shown in   Figure 30.3  .
