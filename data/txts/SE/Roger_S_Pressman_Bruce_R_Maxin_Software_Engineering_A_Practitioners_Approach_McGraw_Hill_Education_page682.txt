652 PART THREE  
QUALITY MANAGEMENTimplement SCM within an organization. Lyon ( 
Practical CM III: Best Practices for the 21st Century,
 
 Raven Publishing, 2013, available at  
www.conﬁ
 guration.org
 
) has written a compre-hensive guide for the CM professional that includes pragmatic guidelines for implementing 
every aspect of a conﬁ guration management system (updated yearly). Girod and Shpichko 
( IBM Rational ClearCase 7.0: Master the Tools That Monitor, Analyze, and Manage Software 
Conﬁ gurations
 
, Packt, 2011) and Bellagio and Mulligan present SCM within the context of one of the more popular SCM tools.   
 
Berczuk and Appleton ( Software Conﬁ
 guration Management Patterns,
 
 Addison-
Wesley, 2003) present a variety of useful patterns that assist in understanding SCM and 

implementing effective SCM systems. Brown et al. ( Anti-Patterns and Patterns in Software 
Conﬁ guration Management,
 
 Wiley, 1999) discuss the things not to do (anti-patterns) when 
implementing an SCM process and then consider their remedies. Humble and Fowler 
( Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment 
Automation, 
 Addison-Wesley, 2010) and Bays ( 
Software Release Methodology,
 
 Prentice Hall, 
1999) focuses on the mechanics of “successful product release,” an important complement 
to effective SCM.   
 
As WebApps have become more dynamic, content management has become an essential 
topic for Web engineers. Books by Rockley and Cooper ( 
Managing Enterprise Content: A Uniﬁ ed Content Strategy,
 
 2nd ed., New Riders, 2012), Jenkins and his colleagues ( 
Managing Content in the Cloud—Enterprise Content Management 2.0, 
 Open Text Corporation, 2010) 
and ( Enterprise Content Management Methods, 
 Open Text Corporation, 2005), White ( 
The Content Management Handbook, 
 Curtin University Books, 2005), Boiko [Boi04], Mauthe and 
Thomas ( Professional Content Management Systems,
 
 Wiley, 2004), Addey and his colleagues 
( Content Management Systems, 
 Glasshaus, 2003), Hackos ( 
Content Management for Dynamic Web Delivery,
 
 Wiley, 2002), and Nakano ( 
Web Content Management,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 2001) 
present worthwhile treatments of the subject.   
 
In addition to generic discussions of the topic, Halvorson and Bach ( Content Strategy for the Web,
 
 2nd ed., New Riders, 2012), Hauschildt ( 
CMS Made Simple 1.6: Beginners’ Guide 
, Packt, 2010), Lim and his colleagues ( Enhancing Microsoft Content Management Server with 
ASP.NET 2.0,
 
 Packt Publishing, 2006), Ferguson ( 
Creating Content Management Systems in 
Java, 
 Charles River Media, 2006), IBM Redbooks ( 
IBM Workplace Web Content Management 
for Portal 5.1 and IBM Workplace Web Content Management 2.5,
 
 Vivante, 2006), Fritz and 
his colleagues ( Typo3: Enterprise Content Management,
 
 Packt Publishing, 2005), and Forta 
( Reality ColdFusion: Intranets and Content Management, 
 Pearson Education, 2002) present content management within the context of speciﬁ c tools and languages.
