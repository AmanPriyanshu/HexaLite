396 PART TWO  
MODELING 
 
Engineering. 
 Involves architectural design, navigation design, interface de-sign, content design, and content production. Software engineers examine the 
constraints imposed by the targeted mobile devices, including considerations 
imposed by the wireless network technologies chosen and the nature of the 
Web services required to implement the MobileApp. 
  
Implementation and Testing.
 
 During this activity, the MobileApp is coded 
and tested. Among the issues that can make testing a challenge are: (1) high 
loss rates due to radio interference and frequent disconnection due to network 
coverage issues, (2) frequent data transmission delays due to relatively low 
bandwidth, and (3) security concerns because mobile devices are less secure 
and relatively easy to attack.   
User Evaluation. 
 The MobileApp is assessed for usability and accessibility then the formulation process begins for the next increment.   
 
Andreou [And05] suggests that ubiquity, personalization, ﬂ
 exibility, and localiza-
tion should be overriding design goals for every MobileApp. Mobile users expect to 

have the ability to receive information and conduct transactions in real time regard-
less of their physical location or the number of concurrent users. Mobile applications 

should present services and applications that are customized according to the pref-
erences of the user. Users of mobile devices should be able to engage in activities 

such as receiving information or conducting transactions with ease. Mobile users 

should have access to local information and services. This implies recognizing the 

importance or context when designing the MobileApp user experience. 
 What should 
we consider when assessing 
MobileApp 
quality? ?  
Formulating MobileApp Requirements   
Formulating MobileApp Requirements 
 
 
The scene:  A meeting room. The 
ﬁ rst meeting to identify requirements 
for a mobile version of the  SafeHome 
 WebApp. 
  
The players:  Jamie Lazar, software team member; 
Vinod Raman, software team member; Ed Robbins, soft-
ware team member; Doug Miller, software engineering 

manager; three members of marketing; a product engi-
neering representative; and a facilitator. 
  
The conversation:    
Facilitator (pointing at whiteboard):  So that’s the 
current list of objects and services for the home security 

function present in the WebApp. 
  
Vinod (interrupting):  My understanding is that people 
want  SafeHome 
 functionality to be accessible from mobile 
 
  
Marketing person:  Yes, that’
add that functionality and try to make it context aware 

to help personalize the user experience.   
Facilitator:  Context aware in what sense? 
  
Marketing person:  People might want to use a 
smartphone instead of the control panel and avoid 

logging on to a website when they are in the driveway 
at home. Or they might not want all family members 
to have access to the master control dashboard for the 
system from their phones.   
Facilitator:  Do you have speciﬁ
 c mobile devices in 
mind?   
Marketing person:  Well, all smartphones would be 
nice. We will have a Web version done, so won’t the 

MobileApp run on all of them?  SAFEHOME pre22126_ch18_391-410.indd   396pre22126_ch18_391-410.indd   39616/12/13   6:23 PM16/12/13   6:23 PM
