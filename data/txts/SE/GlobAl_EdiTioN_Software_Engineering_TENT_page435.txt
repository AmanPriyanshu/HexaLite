PART This part of the book covers more advanced software engineering topics. 
I assume in these chapters that readers understand the basics of the disci-
pline, covered in Chapters 1Œ9.Chapters 15Œ18 focus on the dominant development paradigm for web-

based information systems and enterprise systemsŠsoftware reuse. 

Chapter 15 introduces the topic and explains the different types of reuse 

that are possible. I then cover the most common approach to reuse, 

which is the reuse of application systems. These are configured and 

adapted to the specific needs of each business.
Chapter 16 is concerned with the reuse of software components rather 
than entire software systems. In this chapter, I explain what is meant by a 

component and why standard component models are needed for effec-
tive component reuse. I also discuss the general process of component-
based software engineering and the problems of component composition.
The majority of large systems are now distributed systems and Chapter 17 
covers issues and problems of building distributed systems. I introduce 

the client-server approach as a fundamental paradigm of distributed sys
-
tems engineering, and explain ways of implementing this architectural 

style. The final section explains software as a serviceŒthe delivery of soft
-
ware functionality over the Internet, which has changed the market for 

software products.3 ˜˚˛˝˙ˆˇ˚˘
