˜4. Quantitatively managed At this level, there is an organizational responsibility to 
use statistical and other quantitative methods to control subprocesses. That is, col

lected process and product measurements must be used in process management.5. Optimizing At this highest level, the organization must use the process and 
product measurements to drive process improvement. Trends must be analyzed 

and the processes adapted to changing business needs.The work on process maturity levels has had a major impact on the software 
industry. It focused attention on the software engineering processes and practices 

that were used and led to significant improvements in software engineering capabil-
ity. However, there is too much overhead in formal process improvement for small 

companies, and maturity estimation with agile processes is difficult. Consequently, 
only large software companies now use this maturity-focused approach to software 

process improvement.Level 3
