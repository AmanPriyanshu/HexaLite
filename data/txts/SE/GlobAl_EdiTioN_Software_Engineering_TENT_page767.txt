˜˙˜operational profileA set of artificial system inputs that reflect the pattern of inputs that are processed in an operational system. Used in reliability testing.pair programmingA development situation where programmers work in pairs, rather than individually, 

to develop code. A fundamental part of extreme programming.peer-to-peer systemA distributed system where there is no distinction between clients and servers. 
Computers in the system can act as both clients and servers. Peer-to-peer applications 

include file sharing, instant messaging and cooperation support systems.People Capability Maturity Model (P-CMM)A process maturity model that reflects how effective an organization is at managing 
the skills, training and experience of the people in that organization.plan-driven processA software process where all of the process activities are planned before the soft-
ware is developed.planning gameAn approach to project planning based on estimating the time required to imple-
ment user stories. Used in some agile methods.predictor metricA software metric that is used as a basis for making predictions about the character-
istics of a software system, such as its reliability or maintainability.probability of failure on demand (POFOD)A reliability metric that is based on the likelihood of a software system failing 
when a demand for its services is made.process improvementChanging a software development process with the aim of making that process 
more efficient or improving the quality of its outputs. For example, if your aim is 
to˜reduce the number of defects in the delivered software, you might improve a  process by adding new validation activities.process modelAn abstract representation of a process. Process models may be developed from 
various perspectives and can show the activities involved in a process, the artifacts 
used in the process, constraints that apply to the process, and the roles of the people 
enacting the process.process maturity modelA model of the extent to which a process includes good practice and reflective and 
measurement capabilities that are geared to process improvement.
