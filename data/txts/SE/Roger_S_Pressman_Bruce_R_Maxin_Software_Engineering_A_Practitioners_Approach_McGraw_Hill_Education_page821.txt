RISK MANAGEMENT 791Risk information sheetDate:  5/9/09Prob:  80%Impact: high
Risk ID:  P02-4-32Description:Only 70 percent of the software components scheduled for reuse will, in fact, beintegrated into the application.  The remaining functionality will have to be custom 
developed.Refinement/context:Subcondition 1: Certain reusable components were developed by a third party 

with no knowledge of internal design standards. 

Subcondition 2: The design standard for component interfaces has not been 

solidified and may not conform to certain existing reusable components.

Subcondition 3:  Certain reusable components have been implemented in a 

language that is not supported on the target environment.
Mitigation/monitoring:1.  Contact third party to determine conformance with design standards.

2.  Press for interface standards completion; consider component structure when 

deciding on interface protocol.

3.  Check to determine number of components in subcondition 3 category; check 

to determine if language support can be acquired.
Management/contingency plan/trigger:RE computed to be $20,200. Allocate this amount within project contingency cost. Develop revised schedule assuming that 18 additional components will have to be 
custom built; allocate staff accordingly.

Trigger:  Mitigation steps unproductive as of 7/1/09.
Current status:5/12/09: Mitigation steps initiated.Originator: D. Gagne  Assigned: B. Laster

Risk Management  
 
 
 
 Objective: 
  The objective of risk management tools is to assist a project team in deﬁ ning risks, assessing their impact and probability, 
and tracking risks throughout a software project.   
 
Mechanics:   
In general, risk management tools assist in generic risk identiﬁ cation by providing a list of typical 
project and business risks, provide checklists or other 
“interview” techniques that assist in identifying project 

speciﬁ c risks, assign probability and impact to each risk, 
support risk mitigation strategies, and generate many 

different risk-related reports.
