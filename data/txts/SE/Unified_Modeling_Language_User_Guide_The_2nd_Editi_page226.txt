 The values and state of an object are discussed in Chapter 13; attributes are discussed in Chapters 4 and 9. In addition to showing the flow of an object through an activity diagram, you can also show how its role, state and attribute values change. As shown in the figure, you represent the state of an object by naming its state in brackets below the object's name. Similarly, you can represent the value of an object's attributes by rendering them in a compartment below the object's name.
