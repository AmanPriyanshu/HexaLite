Chapters 24 explains the basics of software quality management, as 
practised in large projects. Quality management is concerned with pro-
cesses and techniques for ensuring and improving the quality of soft
-
ware. I discuss the importance of standards in quality management, the 

use of reviews and inspections in the quality assurance process. The final 

section of this chapter covers software measurement and I discuss the 

benefits and problems in using metrics and software data analytics in 

quality management.Finally, Chapter 25 discusses configuration management, a critical issue 
for all large systems. However, the need for configuration management is 

not always obvious to students who have only been concerned with per-
sonal software development, so I describe the various aspects of this 

topic here, including version management, system building, change man
-
agement and release management. I explain why continuous integration 

or daily system building is important. An important change in this edition 

is the inclusion of new material on distributed version management sys
-
tems, such as Git, which are being increasingly used to support software 

engineering by distributed teams.
