 PowerPoint presentations covering a range of systems engineering topics are 
available at pearsonglobaleditions.com/Sommerville.In response to requests from users of the book, I have published a complete 
requirements specification for one of the system case studies on the book™s web site. It is difficult for students to get access to such documents and so understand their 

structure and complexity. To avoid confidentiality issues, I have re-engineered the 
requirements document from a real system so there are no restrictions on its use.Website: software-engineering-book.com
