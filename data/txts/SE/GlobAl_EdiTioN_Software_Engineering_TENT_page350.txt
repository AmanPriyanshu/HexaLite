˜may not respond correctly to commands specifying the amount of insulin to be injected. Alternatively, (3) the dose may be correctly computed, but it is deliv-
ered too early or too late.2.
 The left branch of the fault tree, concerned with incorrect measurement of the 

blood sugar level, identifies how this might happen. This could occur either 

because the sensor that provides an input to calculate the sugar level has failed or 

because the calculation of the blood sugar level has been carried out incorrectly. 

The sugar level is calculated from some measured parameter, such as the conduc-
tivity of the skin. Incorrect computation can result from either an incorrect algo-
rithm or an arithmetic error that results from the use of floating-point numbers.3. The central branch of the tree is concerned with timing problems and concludes 
that these can only result from system timer failure.Incorrect
