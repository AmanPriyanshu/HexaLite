702 PART FOUR  
MANAGING SOFTWARE PROJECTS
Manage a Successful Software Project,
 
 2nd ed., Wiley, 2000) present a number of case studies 
that indicate why some projects succeed and others fail. Books by Kerzner ( Project Manage-
ment: A Systems Approach to Planning Scheduling and Controlling,
 
 10th ed., Wiley, 2009) 
and Bennatan ( On Time Within Budget,
 
 3rd ed., Wiley, 2000) presents useful tips and guide-
lines for software project managers. Weigers ( 
Practical Project Initiation,
 
 Microsoft Press, 
2007) provides practical guidelines for getting a software project off the ground successfully. 
  
 
It can be argued that the most important aspect of software project management is people management. Cockburn ( Agile Software Development,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 2002) pre-
sents one of the best discussions of software people written to date. DeMarco and Lister 
[DeM98] have written the deﬁ nitive book on software people and software projects. In addi-
tion, the following books on this subject have been published in recent years and are worth 
examining:

Even though they do not relate speciﬁ cally to the software world and sometimes suf-
fer from oversimpliﬁ cation and broad generalization, best-selling “management” books by 
Kanter ( Conﬁ dence,
 
 Three Rivers Press, 2006), Covy ( 
The 8th Habit, 
 Free Press, 2004), Bossidy 
( Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done, 
 Crown Publishing, 2002), Drucker ( 
Man-agement Challenges for the 21st Century,
 
 Harper Business, 1999), Buckingham and Coffman 
( First, Break All the Rules: What the World’s Greatest Managers Do Differently,
 
 Simon and 
Schuster, 1999), and Christensen ( 
The Innovator’s Dilemma,
 
 Harvard Business School Press, 
1997) emphasize “new rules” deﬁ ned by a rapidly changing economy. Older titles such as 
 Who Moved My Cheese? 
,  The One-Minute Manager,
 
 and  
In Search of Excellence
 
 continue to 
provide valuable insights that can help you to manage people and projects more effectively. 
  
 
A wide variety of information sources on the software project management are available on the Internet. An up-to-date list of World Wide Web references can be found under “soft-

ware engineering resources” at the SEPA website:
