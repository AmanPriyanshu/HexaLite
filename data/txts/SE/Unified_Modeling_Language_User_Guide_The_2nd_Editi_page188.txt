 Note A use case name may be text consisting of any number of letters, numbers, and most punctuation marks (except for marks such as the colon, which is used to separate a class name and the name of its enclosing package) and may continue over several lines. In practice, use case names are short active verb phrases naming some behavior found in the vocabulary of the system you are modeling.  Use Cases and Actors An actor represents a coherent set of roles that users of use cases play when interacting with these use cases. Typically, an actor represents a role that a human, a hardware device, or even another system plays with a system. For example, if you work for a bank, you might be a LoanOfficer. If you do your personal banking there, as well, you'll also play the role of Customer. An instance of an actor, therefore, represents an individual interacting with the system in a specific way. Although you'll use actors in your models, actors are not actually part of the system. They live outside the system. Generalization is discussed in Chapters 5 and 10. As Figure 16-3 indicates, actors are rendered as stick figures. You can define general kinds of actors (such as Customer) and specialize them (such as CommercialCustomer) using generalization relationships. Figure 16-3 Actors
