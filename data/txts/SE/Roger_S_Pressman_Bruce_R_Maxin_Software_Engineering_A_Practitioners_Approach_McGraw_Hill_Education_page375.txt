CHAPTER 15  
USER INTERFACE DESIGN
 345 
Like interface design for conventional software, the design of Web and mobile 
app interfaces describes the structure and organization of the user interface and 
includes a representation of screen layout, a deﬁ nition of the modes of interac-
tion, and a description of navigation mechanisms. A set of interface design prin-
ciples and an interface design workﬂ ow guide a WebApp or mobile app designer 
when layout and interface control mechanisms are designed.  The user interface is the window into the software. In many cases, the inter-
face molds a user’s perception of the quality of the system. If the “window” is 

smudged, wavy, or broken, the user may reject an otherwise powerful computer- 

based system.

ROBLEMS AND POINTS TO PONDER  
 
 
 
15.1.  Describe the worst interface that you have ever worked with and critique it relative to the concepts introduced in this chapter. Describe the best interface that you have ever 

worked with and critique it relative to the concepts introduced in this chapter. 
   
 
15.2.  Develop two additional design principles that “place the user in control.”    
 
15.3.  Develop two additional design principles that “reduce the user’s memory load.” 
   
 
15.4.  Develop two additional design principles that “make the interface consistent.”    
 
15.5.  Consider one of the following interactive applications (or an application assigned by your instructor):    
 
 
a.  A desktop publishing system     
 
b.  A computer-aided design system 
    
 
c.  An interior design system (as described in Section 15.3.2)     
 
d.  An automated course registration system for a university     
 
e.  A library management system     
 
f.  An Internet-based polling booth for public elections     
 
g.  A home banking system     
 
h.  An interactive application assigned by your instructor  
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
Develop a user model, design model, mental model, and an implementation model, for any one of these systems.    
 
15.6.  Perform a detailed task analysis for any one of the systems listed in Problem 15.5. Use either an elaborative or object-oriented approach.    
 
15.7.  Add at least ﬁ ve additional questions to the list developed for content analysis in Sec-
tion 15.3.3.    
 
15.8.  Continuing Problem 15.5, deﬁ ne interface objects and actions for the application you 
have chosen. Identify each object type.    
 
15.9.  Develop a set of screen layouts with a deﬁ nition of major and minor menu items for the 
system you chose in Problem 15.5.    
 
15.10.  Develop a set of screen layouts with a deﬁ nition of major and minor menu items for 
the  SafeHome 
 system. You may elect to take a different approach than the one shown for 
the screen layout in  Figure 15.3 .     
15.11.  Describe your approach to user help facilities for the task analysis design model and task analysis you have performed as part of Problems 15.5, 15.7, and 15.8.    
 
15.12.  Provide a few examples that illustrate why response time variability can be an issue.  pre22126_ch15_317-346.indd   345pre22126_ch15_317-346.indd   34513/12/13   10:01 PM13/12/13   10:01 PM
