MODELING 
 
 
Implementation-speciﬁ c books on architecture address architectural design within 
a speciﬁ c development environment or technology. Erl ( 
SOA Design Patterns 
, Prentice Hall, 2009) and Marks and Bell ( Service-Oriented Architecture,
 
 Wiley, 2006) discuss a  
design  approach that links business and computational resources with the requirements deﬁ ned 
by customers. Bambilla et al. ( Model-Driven Software Engineering in Practice
 
, Morgan  Claypool, 2012) and Stahl and his colleagues ( Model-Driven Software Development,
 
 Wiley, 
2006) discuss architecture within the context of domain-speciﬁ c modeling approaches. 
 Radaideh and Al-ameed ( Architecture of Reliable Web Applications Software,
 
 IGI Global, 
2007) consider architectures that are appropriate for WebApps. Esposito ( 
Architecting 
Mobile Solutions for the Enterprise 
, Microsoft Press, 2012) discusses architecting mobile applications.  Clements and Northrop ( Software Product Lines: Practices and Patterns,
 
  Addison-Wesley, 2001)  
address the design of architectures that support software product lines. Shanley ( Protected Mode Software Architecture,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 1996) provides ar-
chitectural design guidance for anyone designing PC-based real-time operating systems, 
multitask operating systems, or device drivers.   
 
Current software architecture research is documented yearly in the  Proceedings of the 
International Workshop on Software Architecture,
 
 sponsored by the ACM and other com-
puting organizations, and the  Proceedings of the International Conference on Software 
Engineering. 
   
 
A wide variety of information sources on architectural design are available on the In-ternet. An up-to-date list of World Wide Web references that are relevant to architectural 

design can be found at the SEPA website:
