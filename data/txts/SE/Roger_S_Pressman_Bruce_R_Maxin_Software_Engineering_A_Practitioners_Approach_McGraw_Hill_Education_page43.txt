CHAPTER 1  
THE NATURE OF SOFTWARE
 13and the process through which it is developed. Ray Kurzweil ( How to Create a Mind,
 
 Viking, 
2013) discusses how software will soon mimic human thought and lead to a “singularity” in 
the evolution of humans and machines.   
 
Keeves ( Catching Digital, 
 Business Infomedia Online, 2012) discusses how business lead-
ers must adapt as software evolves at an ever-increasing pace. Minasi ( 
The Software Con-
spiracy: Why Software Companies Put out Faulty Products, How They Can Hurt You, and 

What You Can Do,
 
 McGraw-Hill, 2000) argues that the “modern scourge” of software bugs 
can be eliminated and suggests ways to accomplish this. Books by Eubanks ( Digital Dead End: Fighting for Social Justice in the Information Age, 
 MIT Press, 2011 
) 
 and 
 
 Compaine 
( Digital Divide: Facing a Crisis or Creating a Myth,
 
 MIT Press, 2001) argue that the “divide” 
between those who have access to information resources (e.g., the Web) and those that do 

not is narrowing as we move into the ﬁ rst decade of this century. Books by Kuniavsky ( 
Smart Things: Ubiquitous Computing User Experience Design, 
 Morgan Kaufman, 2010), Greenﬁ
 eld 
( Everyware: The Dawning Age of Ubiquitous Computing,
 
 New Riders Publishing, 2006), and 
Loke ( Context-Aware Pervasive Systems: Architectures for a New Breed of Applications,
 
 Auerbach, 2006) introduce the concept of “open-world” software and predict a wireless en-
vironment in which software must adapt to requirements that emerge in real time.   
 
A wide variety of information sources that discuss the nature of software are available on the Internet. An up-to-date list of World Wide Web references that are relevant to the 

software process can be found at the SEPA website:
