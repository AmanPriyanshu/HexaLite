 211control) to check the operation state for diagnostic purposes before reading or setting a value. The messages  Set Physical Value
 
 and  
Get Physical Value
 
 are not 
messages between objects. Instead, they describe the interaction between the 
physical devices of the system and their software counterparts. In the lower part 
of the diagram, below the horizontal line, the  PositionSensor 
 reports that the op-
eration state is zero. The  ComputingComponent 
 then sends the error code for a 
position sensor failure to the  FaultHandler 
 that will decide how this error affects 
the system and what actions are required. It gets the data from the sensors and 
computes the required response for the actuators. Passive integer
