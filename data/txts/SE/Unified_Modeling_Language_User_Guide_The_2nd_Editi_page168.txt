expresses the static part of an interaction, consisting of the objects that collaborate, but without any of the messages passed among them. In both cases, an object diagram freezes a moment in time, as in Figure 14-1.

Graphically, an object diagram is a collection of vertices and arcs Common Properties The general properties of diagrams are discussed in Chapter 7. An object diagram is a special kind of diagram and shares the same common properties as all other diagrams#that is, a name and graphical contents that are a projection into a model.
