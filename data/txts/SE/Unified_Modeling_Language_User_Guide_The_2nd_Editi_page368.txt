 Each phase and iteration has some risk mitigation focus and concludes with a well-defined milestone. The milestone review provides a point in time to assess how well key goals have been met and whether the project needs to be restructured in any way to proceed. Phases Inception    During the inception phase, you establish the business case for the system and delimit the project's scope. The business case includes success criteria, risk assessment, estimates of the resources needed, and a phase plan showing a schedule of major milestones. During inception, it's common to create an executable prototype that serves as a proof of concept. At the end of the inception phase, you examine the life cycle objectives of the project and decide whether to proceed with full-scale development. Elaboration    The goals of the elaboration phase are to analyze the problem domain, establish a sound architectural foundation, develop the project plan, and eliminate the highest risk elements of the project. Architectural decisions must be made with an understanding of the whole system. This implies that you describe most of the system's requirements. To verify the architecture, you implement a system that demonstrates the architectural choices and executes significant use cases. At the end of the elaboration phase, you examine the detailed system objectives and scope, the choice of architecture, and the resolution of major risks, and decide whether to proceed with construction. Construction    During the construction phase, you iteratively and incrementally develop a complete product that is ready to transition to its user community. This implies describing the remaining requirements
