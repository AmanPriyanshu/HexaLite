˜˚˛˝˙˙ˆˇ˘˜˜
˜˙˝reductionismAn engineering approach that relies on breaking down a problem to sub-problems, solving these sub-problems independently then integrating these solutions to create 
the solution to the larger problem.reengineeringThe modification of a software system to make it easier to understand and change. 
Reengineering often involves software and data restructuring and organization,  program simplification and redocumentation.reengineering, business processChanging a business process to meet a new organizational objective such as 
reduced cost and faster execution.refactoringModifying a program to improve its structure and readability without changing its 
functionality.reference architectureA generic, idealized architecture that includes all the features that systems might 
incorporate. It is a way of informing designers about the general structure of that 
class of system rather than a basis for creating a specific system architecture.releaseA version of a software system that is made available to system customers.reliabilityThe ability of a system to deliver services as specified. Reliability can be specified  quantitatively as a probability of failure on demand or as the rate of  occurrence of˜failure.reliability growth modelingThe development of a model of how the reliability of a system changes (improves) 
as it is tested and program defects are removed.requirement, functionalA statement of some function or feature that should be implemented in a system.requirement, non-functionalA statement of a constraint or expected behavior that applies to a system. This  constraint may refer to the emergent properties of the software that is being  developed or to the development process.requirements managementThe process of managing changes to requirements to ensure that the changes made 
are properly analyzed and tracked through the system.resilienceA judgement of how well a system can maintain the continuity of its critical services 

in the presence of disruptive events, such as equipment failure and cyberattacks.
