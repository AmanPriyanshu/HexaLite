FORMAL MODELING AND VERIFICATION
 617only if the name that is to be added is not contained in the table and also if there are fewer than  MaxIds 
 staff identiﬁ
 ers in the table. The  
postcondition 
 of an op-
eration deﬁ nes what is guaranteed to be true upon completion of an operation. 
This is deﬁ ned by its effect on the data. For the  
add() 
 operation, the postcondition 
would specify mathematically that the table has been augmented with the new 
identiﬁ er. 
 
 
 
Example 2: A block handler.   
One of the more important parts of a simple oper-
ating system is the subsystem that maintains ﬁ les created by users. Part of the ﬁ
 l-
ing subsystem is the  block handler.
 
 Files in the ﬁ
 le store are composed of blocks 
of storage that are held on a ﬁ le storage device. During the operation of the com-
puter, ﬁ
 les will be created and deleted, requiring the acquisition and release of 
blocks of storage. In order to cope with this, the ﬁ ling subsystem will maintain a 
reservoir of unused (free) blocks and keep track of blocks that are currently in 
use. When blocks are released from a deleted ﬁ le, they are normally added to 
a queue of blocks waiting to be added to the reservoir of unused blocks. This is 
shown in  Figure 28.8 . In this ﬁ gure, a number of components are shown: the res-
ervoir of unused blocks, the blocks that currently make up the ﬁ les administered 
by the operating system, and those blocks that are waiting to be added to the 
reservoir. The waiting blocks are held in a queue, with each element of the queue 

containing a set of blocks from a deleted ﬁ le. 
 
 
 
 
  For this subsystem the state is the collection of free blocks, the collection of used blocks, and the queue of returned blocks. The data invariant, expressed in 
natural language, is  
 
 
•  No block will be marked as both unused and used.   
 
 
•  All the sets of blocks held in the queue will be subsets of the collection of currently used blocks.  1  3  4  6  9File #15  8  11File #27File #3Block queue containing blocks from deleted filesUnused blocks2Queued for entry into unused blocks
