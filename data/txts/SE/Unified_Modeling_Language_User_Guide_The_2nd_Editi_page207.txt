Interaction diagrams commonly contain · Objects · Links · Messages Note An interaction diagram is basically a projection of the elements found in an interaction. The semantics of an interaction's context, objects and roles, links, messages, and sequencing apply to interaction diagrams.  Like all other diagrams, interaction diagrams may contain notes and constraints. Sequence Diagrams A sequence diagram emphasizes the time ordering of messages. As Figure 18-2 shows, you form a sequence diagram by first placing the objects that participate in the interaction at the top of your diagram, across the X axis. Typically, you place the object that initiates the interaction at the left, and increasingly more subordinate objects to the right. Next, you place the messages that these objects send and receive along the Y axis, in order of increasing time from top to bottom. This gives the reader a clear visual cue to the flow of control over time. Figure 18-2 Sequence Diagram  Sequence diagrams have two features that distinguish them from collaboration diagrams.
