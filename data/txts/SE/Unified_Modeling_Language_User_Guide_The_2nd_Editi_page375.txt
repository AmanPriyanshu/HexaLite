A mechanism that describes structural and behavioral features. Classifiers include classes, interfaces, datatypes, signals, components, nodes, use cases, and subsystems.  client  A classifier that requests service from another classifier.  collaboration  A society of roles and other elements that work together to provide some cooperative behavior that's bigger than the sum of all its parts; the specification of how an element, such as a use case or an operation, is realized by a set of classifiers and associations playing specific roles and used in a specific way.  collaboration diagram  An interaction diagram that emphasizes the structural organization of the objects that send and receive messages; a diagram that shows interactions organized around instances and their links to each other.  comment  An annotation attached to an element or a collection of elements.  component  A physical and replaceable part of a system that conforms to and provides the realization of a set of interfaces.  component diagram  A diagram that shows the organization of and dependencies among a set of components; component diagrams address the static implementation view of a system.  composite  A class that is related to one or more classes by a composition relationship.  composite state  A state that consists of either concurrent substates or disjoint substates.  composition  A form of aggregation with strong ownership and coincident lifetime of the parts by the whole; parts with nonfixed multiplicity may be created after the composite itself, but once created they live and die with it; such parts can also be explicitly removed before the death of the composite.
