Attributes Attributes arerelated to the semantics ofaggregation, as discussed in Chapter 10. An attribute is a named property of a class that describes a range of values that instances of the property may hold. A class may have any number of attributes or no attributes at all. An attribute represents some property of the thing you are modeling that is shared by all objects of that class. For example, every wall has a height, width, and thickness; you might model your customers in such a way that each has a name, address, phone number, and date of birth. An attribute is therefore an abstraction of the kind of data or state an object of the class might encompass. At a given moment, an object of a class will have specific values for every one of its class's attributes. Graphically, attributes are listed in a compartment just below the class name. Attributes may be drawn showing only their names, as shown in Figure 4-3. Figure 4-3 Attributes  Note An attribute name may be text, just like a class name. In practice, an attribute name is a short noun or noun phrase that represents some property of its enclosing class. Typically, you capitalize the first letter of every word in an attribute name except the first letter, as in name or loadBearing.  You can specify other features of anattribute, such as marking it read-only or shared by all objects of the class, as discussed in Chapter 9. You can further specify an attribute by stating its class and possibly a default initial value, as shown Figure 4-4. Figure 4-4 Attributes and Their Class
