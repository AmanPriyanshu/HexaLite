EFINING A FRAMEWORK ACTIVITY  
 
 
 
 
Although we have described ﬁ ve framework activities and provided a basic deﬁ
 -nition of each in Chapter 2, a software team would need signiﬁ cantly more infor-
mation before it could properly execute any one of these activities as part of the 
software process. Therefore, you are faced with a key question:  What actions are 
appropriate for a framework activity, given the nature of the problem to be solved, 

the characteristics of the people doing the work, and the stakeholders who are 

sponsoring the project?
 
  
 uote:  “If the process is 
right, the results 
will take care of 
themselves.”  Takashi Osada
