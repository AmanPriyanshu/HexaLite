CHAPTER 11  
REQUIREMENTS MODELING: BEHAVIOR, PATTERNS, AND WEB/MOBILE APPS
 223and Technologies,
 
 Information Science Reference, 2009) have edited an anthology that ad-
dresses behavioral modeling techniques for embedded systems.   
 
The majority of books written about software patterns focus on software design. However, books by Vaughn ( 
Implementing Domain-Driven Design 
, Addison-Wesley, 2013), 
Whithall ( Software Requirement Patterns,
 
 Microsoft Press, 2007), Evans ( 
Domain-Driven Design, 
 Addison-Wesley, 2003) and Fowler ([Fow03] and [Fow97]) address analysis patterns 
speciﬁ cally. 
  
 
An in-depth treatment of analysis modeling for WebApps is presented by Pressman and 
Lowe [Pre08]. Books by Rossi and his colleagues ( Web Engineering: Modeling and Implement-
ing Web Applications,
 
 Springer, 2010) and Neil ( 
Mobile Design Pattern Gallery: UI Patterns, 
 O’Reilly, 2012) discuss the use of patterns in app development. Papers contained within 

an anthology edited by Murugesan and Desphande  (Web Engineering: Managing Diversity 
and Complexity of Web Application Development,
 
 Springer, 2001) treat various aspects of 
WebApp requirements. In addition, the annual  
Proceeding of the International Conference 
on Web Engineering
 
 regularly addresses requirements modeling issues.   
 
A wide variety of information sources on requirements modeling are available on the Internet. An up-to-date list of World Wide Web references that are relevant to analysis mod-

eling can be found at the SEPA website:
