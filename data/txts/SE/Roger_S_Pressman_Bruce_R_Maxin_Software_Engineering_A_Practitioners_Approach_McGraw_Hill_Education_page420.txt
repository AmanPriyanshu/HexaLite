MODELINGguidelines for WebApp design is presented, worthwhile examples of Web pages and Java 
programming are shown, and the technical details important for implementing modern 
WebApps are discussed. Among the many offerings in this category are books by Butler (

 How Books, 2013), Campos ( 
Web Design Source Book,
 
 PromoPress, 
2013), DeFederici ( The Web Designer’s Roadmap,

tailed examples of WebApps modeled using UML. 
  
 
A wide variety of information sources on design for WebApps is available on the Internet. 
An up-to-date list of World Wide Web references can be found under “software engineering
