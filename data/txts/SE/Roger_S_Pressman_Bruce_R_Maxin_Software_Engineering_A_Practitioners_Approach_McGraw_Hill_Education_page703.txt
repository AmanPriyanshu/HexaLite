PRODUCT METRICS 673   •
  Is the content designed in a manner that imparts the most information 
with the least effort?  
   •
  Is navigation efﬁ cient and straightforward?  
   •
  Has the WebApp architecture been designed to accommodate the special 

goals and objectives of WebApp users, the structure of content and func-

tionality, and the ﬂ ow of navigation required to use the system effectively?  
   •
  Are components designed in a manner that reduces procedural complex-
ity and enhances the correctness, reliability, and performance?    
 Today, each of these questions can be addressed only qualitatively because a 

 validated suite of metrics that would provide quantitative answers does not yet 
exist.  In the paragraphs that follow, we present a representative sampling of Web 
and MobileApp design metrics that have been proposed in the literature. It is 
important to note that many of these metrics have not as yet been validated and 
should be used judiciously. 
     
  
Interface metrics.   For WebApps, the following interface measures can be 
considered: 
     
Suggested MetricDescriptionLayout appropriatenessThe relative position of entities within the interface

Layout complexityNumber of distinct regions

   defined for an interface 
Layout region complexityAverage number of distinct links per region

Recognition complexityAverage number of distinct items the user must look at before making a 
navigation or data input decisionRecognition time Average time (in seconds) that it takes a user to select the appropriate 
action for a given taskTyping effortAverage number of key strokes required for a specific function

Mouse pick effortAverage number of mouse picks per function

Selection complexityAverage number of links that can be selected per page

Content acquisition timeAverage number of words of text per Web page
Memory load
Average number of distinct data items that the user must remember to 

achieve a specific objective      
Aesthetic (graphic design) metrics.   By its nature, aesthetic design relies on qual-itative judgment and is not generally amenable to measurement and metrics.    Many of these metrics 

are applicable to all 
user interfaces and 

should be considered 
in conjunction with 
those presented in

 A distinct region is an area within the layout display that accomplishes some speciﬁ c set of 
related functions (e.g., a menu bar, a static graphical display, a content area, an animated 

display).
