Time-Line Charts 
 
When creating a software project schedule, you begin with a set of tasks (the work breakdown structure). If automated tools are used, the work breakdown is 
input as a task network or task outline. Effort, duration, and start date are then 
input for each task. In addition, tasks may be assigned to speciÔ¨Å c individuals. 
  
 
 
 
 
As a consequence of this input, a  time-line chart, 
 also called a  
Gantt chart, 
 is generated. A time-line chart can be developed for the entire project. Alter-

natively, separate charts can be developed for each project function or for each 

individual working on the project.   
 
Figure 34.3  
 illustrates the format of a time-line chart. It depicts a part of a 
software project schedule that emphasizes the  concept scoping 
 task for a 
word-processing (WP) software product. All project tasks (for concept scoping) 
are listed in the left-hand column. The horizontal bars indicate the duration of 
each task. When multiple bars occur at the same time on the calendar, task con-

currency is implied. The diamonds indicate milestones.  
 
 
 
  Once the information necessary for the generation of a time-line chart has been input, the majority of software project scheduling tools produce  project 
   A time-line chart 
enables you to 
determine what tasks 

will be conducted at a 
given point in time. Identify needs and benefitsMeet with customers
