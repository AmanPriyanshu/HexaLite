QUALITY MANAGEMENT 
 
 
•   
Emulators and plug-ins 
—The same test can be executed on different de-vices and different mobile operating systems using the existing testing 
environment.   
 
 
•   
Connectivity 
—Simultaneous connection of multiple devices using USB, Wi-Fi, private cloud, and phone carrier to test connection stability and 

recovery. 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Selected Tools for MobileApp Testing 
  
Here is a list of several tools that might be useful in MobileApp testing. This is a very 
volatile ﬁ eld. This list of representative tools was recently 
recommended by Brown [Bro11] and Vinson [Vin11].  6 
 
 
   
Mobile Web page tools
 
 try to determine the degree 
to which a Web page is mobile device friendly. User

Device emulators 
 are virtual devices that typically run 
on a personal computer and allow you to develop and 

test MobileApps without access to physical devices. 
  
Representative Tools 
  
Android Emulators ( http://developer.android

)  iPad Peek ( http://ipadpeek.com/ 
)  Adobe Edge Inspect  http://html.adobe.com/edge/inspect/ 
)  Blackberry Simulators (

)   
Automated tools 
 record interactions on IOS or Android and allows their play back as test scripts. 
Typically these run on a personal computer with a 

device emulator.

Network monitoring tools 
 add, modify, and ﬁ

HTTP request headers sent to Web servers. Installs as 

a browser plug-in.   
Representative Tool 
  
Modify headers ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-

)   
Mobile analytics testing 
 collects data to allow analysis of how users interact with the MobileApp 
which is important to assess ROI (return on 

investment). Typically requires a Web or cloud 

service to assist in data collection and storage.
