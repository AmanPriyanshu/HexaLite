reserve the use of their name in a manner that is consistent with the UML's metamodel. In the following table, keywords are highlighted in italics.  Typically, a stereotyped element is rendered by placing the stereotype name above the element's name and enclosing the stereotype name in guillemets, as in  trace!. Each stereotype may have an associated icon that may be used as an alternative form for visualizing the element. Although the UML does not specify such icons for any of the standard stereotypes, the following table offers a few suggested notations drawn from common practice. Stereotype/ Keywordord  Applies to symbol  Meaning  actor  class Specifies a coherent set of roles that users of use cases play when interacting with these use cases access  dependency Specifies that the public contents of the target package are accessible to the namespace of the source package association  link end Specifies that the corresponding object is visible by association become  message Specifies that the target is the same object as the source but at a later point in time and with possibly different values, state, or roles bind  dependency Specifies that the source instantiates the target template using the given actual parameters call  dependency Specifies that the source operation invokes the target operation copy  message Specifies that the target object is an exact but independent copy of the source create  event message Specifies that the target object is created by the event or the message derive  dependency Specifies that the source may be computed from the target destroy  event message Specifies that the target object is destroyed by the event or the message document  component Specifies a component that represents a document enumeration  class Specifies an enumerated type, including its possible values as a set of identifiers exception  class Specifies an event that may be thrown or caught by an operation
