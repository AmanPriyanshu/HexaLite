QUALITY MANAGEMENTany procedural statements (e.g., see the ﬂ ow graph symbol for the if-then-else 
construct). Areas bounded by edges and nodes are called  regions.
 
 When counting 
regions, we include the area outside the graph as a region.  4 
 
   
When compound conditions are encountered in a procedural design, the gen-eration of a ﬂ ow graph becomes slightly more complicated. A compound con-
dition occurs when one or more Boolean operators (logical OR, AND, NAND, 
NOR) is present in a conditional statement. Referring to  Figure 23.3 , the program design language (PDL) segment translates into the ﬂ ow graph shown. Note that 
a separate node is created for each of the conditions  a 
 and  
b 
 in the statement 
IF  a 
 OR  
b. 
 Each node that contains a condition is called a  
predicate node
 
 and is 
characterized by two or more edges emanating from it.

Independent Program Paths 
 
An  independent path 
 is any path through the program that introduces at least 
one new set of processing statements or a new condition. When stated in terms 
of a ﬂ ow graph, an independent path must move along at least one edge that has 
not been traversed before the path is deﬁ ned. For example, a set of independent 
paths for the ﬂ ow graph illustrated in  
Figure 23.2b  is  
 
 
 
 
 
Path 1: 1-11 
   
 
 
 
 
Path 2: 1-2-3-4-5-10-1-11 
   
 
 
 
 
Path 3: 1-2-3-6-8-9-10-1-11 
   
 
 
 
 
Path 4: 1-2-3-6-7-9-10-1-11 
 
 
  Note that each new path introduces a new edge. The path
