CHAPTER 16  
PATTERN-BASED DESIGN
 355 
Shalloway and Trott [Sha05] suggest the following approach 
 5 
 
 that enables a 
designer to think in patterns:  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 1.
  Be sure you understand the big picture—the context in which the software to be built resides. The requirements model should communicate this 
  
 
 
 2.
  Examining the big picture, extract the patterns that are present at that level of abstraction.   
 
 
 3.
  Begin your design with “big picture” patterns that establish a context or skeleton for further design work.   
 
 
 4.
  “Work inward from the context” [Sha05] looking for patterns at lower 
levels of abstraction that contribute to the design solution.   
 
 
 5.
  Repeat steps 1 to 4 until the complete design is ﬂ eshed out. 
  
 
 
 6.
  Reﬁ ne the design by adapting each pattern to the speciﬁ
 cs of the software 
you’re trying to build.   
 
5  Based on the work of Christopher Alexander [Ale79]. 
 Pattern-
based design looks interesting 
for the problem 
I have to solve.

started? ? FIGURE 16.1
