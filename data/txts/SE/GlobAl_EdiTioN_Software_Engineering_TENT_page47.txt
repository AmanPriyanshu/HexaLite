can be instantiated in different ways to create processes that resemble any of the 
general process models discussed here. The RUP has been adopted by some large 
software companies (notably IBM), but it has not gained widespread acceptance.The first published model of the software development process was derived from 

engineering process models used in large military systems engineering (Royce 

1970). It presents the software development process as a number of stages, as shown 

in Figure 2.1. Because of the cascade from one phase to another, this model is known 
as the waterfall model or software life cycle. The waterfall model is an example of a 

plan-driven process. In principle at least, you plan and schedule all of the process 

activities before starting software development.The stages of the waterfall model directly reflect the fundamental software devel-opment activities:1. Requirements analysis and definition The system™s services, constraints, and 
goals are established by consultation with system users. They are then defined 
in detail and serve as a system specification.2. System and software design The systems design process allocates the require-
ments to either hardware or software systems. It establishes an overall system 
architecture. Software design involves identifying and describing the funda-
mental software system abstractions and their relationships.3. Implementation and unit testing During this stage, the software design is real-
ized as a set of programs or program units. Unit testing involves verifying that 
each unit meets its specification.RequirementsdefinitionSystem and
