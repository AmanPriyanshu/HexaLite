is distributed so that data about each market is maintained separately. Assets required to support the critical activity of equity trading (user accounts and prices) are repli
-
cated and available on all nodes. If a node of the system is attacked and becomes 

unavailable, the critical activity of equity trading can be transferred to another coun-
try and so can still be available to users.I have already discussed the problem of finding a balance between security and system performance. A problem of secure system design is that in many cases, the 
architectural style that is best for the security requirements may not be the best one 
for meeting the performance requirements. For example, say an application has an 
absolute requirement to maintain the confidentiality of a large database and another 
requirement for very fast access to that data. A high-level of protection suggests that 
layers of protection are required, which means that there must be communications 
between the system layers. This has an inevitable performance overhead and so will 
slow down access to the data.If an alternative architecture is used, then implementing protection and guaran-teeing confidentiality may be more difficult and expensive. In such a situation, you 
have to discuss the inherent conflicts with the customer who is paying for the system 
and agree on how these conflicts are to be resolved.US equity dataUS tradinghistoryInternationalequity pricesUS funds dataUS user accountsInternationaluser accountsNew York trading system
