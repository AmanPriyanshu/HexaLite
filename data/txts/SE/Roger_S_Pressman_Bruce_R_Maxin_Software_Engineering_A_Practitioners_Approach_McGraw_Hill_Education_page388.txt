16.2.4  Building a Pattern-Organizing Table 
 
As pattern-based design proceeds, you may encounter trouble organizing and categorizing candidate patterns from multiple pattern languages and reposito-
ries. To help organize your evaluation of candidate patterns, Microsoft [Mic13] 

suggests the creation of a  pattern-organizing table
 
 that takes the general form 
shown in  Figure 16.2 .   
 
 
 
 
A pattern-organizing table can be implemented as a spreadsheet model using the form shown in the ﬁ gure. An abbreviated list of problem statements, orga-
nized by data/content, architecture, component level, and user interface issues, 
is presented in the left-hand (shaded) column. Four pattern types—database, ap-
plication, implementation, and infrastructure—are listed across the top row. The 

names of candidate patterns are noted in the cells of the table.  To provide entries for the organizing table, you’ll search through pattern 
languages and repositories for patterns that address a particular problem 

statement. When one or more candidate patterns is found, it is entered in 

the row corresponding to the problem statement and the column that corre-
sponds to the pattern type. The name of the pattern is entered as a hyperlink 

to the URL of the Web address that contains a complete description of the 

pattern.
