involved. For example, MODAF and DODAF are comparable frameworks from the 
UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) and the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD).The TOGAF framework has been developed by the Open Group as an open stand
-ard and is intended to support the design of a business architecture, a data architec-
ture, an application architecture, and a technology architecture for an enterprise. At 

its heart is the Architecture Development Method (ADM), which consists of a num-
ber of discrete phases. These are shown in Figure 20.9, taken from the TOGAF refer-
ence documentation (Open Group 2011).All architectural frameworks involve the production and management of a large set of architectural models. Each of the activities shown in Figure 20.8 leads to the 
production of system models. However, this is problematic for two reasons:1. Initial model development takes a long time and involves extensive negotiations between system stakeholders. This slows the development of the overall system.2. It is time-consuming and expensive to maintain model consistency as changes 
are made to the organization and the constituent systems in a SoS.Architecture frameworks are fundamentally reductionist, and they largely ignore 
sociotechnical and political issues. While they do recognize that problems are diffi
-
cult to define and are open-ended, they assume a degree of control and governance
