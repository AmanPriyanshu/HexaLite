CHAPTER 18  
MOBILEAPP DESIGN 405applications in mobile game development (a multibillion-dollar industry). Most popular games are developed in parallel for several mobile devices. This type of 
development fragmentation drives up costs and underscores the need for bet-
ter standardization of development tools and APIs. Galavas [Gal11] notes that 
portability, functionality, development speed, and performance are key selection 

criteria when considering which mobile development platforms to use.  Mobile computing middleware can be used to facilitate the communication and coordination of distributed system components. This can allow mobile ap-
plication developers to rely on abstractions that hide the details of some of the 
complexities of mobile environments. For middleware to be useful in MobileApp 
development, both the mobile client and the mobile service provider must allow 
for asynchronous intermittent connections. The middleware components run-
ning on the mobile client must not consume signiﬁ cant computational resources 
on the mobile device. The middleware must also help the mobile application 
achieve the level of context awareness required by its users [Mas02].

large-scale distributed applications [Yau11]. These computing paradigms have 

made it easier and more economical to create applications on many different 
devices (personal computers, smartphones, and tablets). The two paradigms
