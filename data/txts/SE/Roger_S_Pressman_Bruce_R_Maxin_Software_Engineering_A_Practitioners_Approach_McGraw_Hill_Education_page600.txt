26.2.1   
Are Conventional Approaches Applicable? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A comprehensive MobileApp testing program includes the generic spiral ap-proach discussed in Chapter 22, but will also include adaptations discussed 
for client-server architectures, real-time computing, graphical user interfaces, 
WebApps, and object-oriented systems (Chapters 23–25). MobileApp testing also 

has unique challenges that should be addressed to ensure that an app meets 
both its functional and nonfunctional requirements.  1 
 
 
  Vinson [Vin11] suggests that MobileApp testers adapt the strategy used for test-
ing WebApps (Chapter 25). Content must be tested to be sure that it was chosen 

with the limitations of mobile devices and ad hoc networks in mind. Compatibility 

testing and deployment testing are more challenging in the mobile world, owing 

to the large variety in device characteristics and user environments. Performance 

testing needs to determine whether the limited storage, processing, connectivity, 

and power available on a mobile device may negatively impact features or func-
tionality. MobileApp performance testing is often conducted at a level of detail 
   Those who must test 
MobileApps are well 
served by adopting 

the overall strategy for 
testing WebApps 
  
 
MobileApp Testing—Checklist 
  
Nari Kannnan, CEO of the mobile appli-cations consulting company appsparq, 
MobileApps [Kan11]:  
 
 
•   
Conceptual testing 
—Getting input from prospective users of the MobileApp prior to beginning 
development helps ensure that no unnecessary 

features are included and no essential features have 
been missed. (Requirements gathering and validation 
  
 
 
•   
Unit and system testing 
—Implementing regular unit and system testing accommodates any software 
application that contains multiple components and 
interacts with networks (Chapters 22 and 26).   
 
 
•   
User experience testing 
—Involving real users early in the development process ensures that 
the experience provided lives up to the usability 
and accessibility expectations of its stakeholders. 
MobileApp usability testing is discussed in 
  
 
 
•   
Stability testing 
—Ensuring that the MobileApp does not crash owing to incompatibilities with network or Web services. Testing MobileApps 
in production environments is discussed in 
  
 
 
•   
Connectivity testing 
—Testing access to all 
essential components and Web resources is essential 

to ensuring the MobileApp is making appropriate 
use of context. Testing across borders is discussed in 

Section 26.6.   
 
 
•   
Performance testing
 
—Testing the ability of the 
MobileApp to meet its nonfunction requirements 
(download times, processor speed, storage capacity, 

etc.). Performance testing is discussed in Sections 

26.2.4 and 26.5.   
 
 
•   
Device compatibility testing 
—Verifying that the 
MobileApp runs correctly on all targeted devices. The 
task is discussed in Section 26.2.3.   
 
 
•   
Security testing 
—Ensuring the MobileApp meets the security requirements set by its stakeholders. 
Security assurance testing is discussed in Chapter 27.   
 
 
•   
Certiﬁ
 cation testing 
—Checking that the MobileApp meets the standards established by the 
app stores that will distribute it.
