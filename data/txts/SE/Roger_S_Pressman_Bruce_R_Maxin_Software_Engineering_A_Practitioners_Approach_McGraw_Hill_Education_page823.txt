35.8.  Develop a risk monitoring strategy and speciﬁ c risk monitoring activities for three 
of the risks noted in   
Figure 35.2  
. Be sure to identify the factors that you’ll be monitoring to determine whether the risk is becoming more or less likely. 
   
 
35.9.  Develop a risk management strategy and speciﬁ c risk management activities for three 
of the risks noted in   
Figure 35.2  
.    
 
35.10.  Attempt to reﬁ ne three of the risks noted in  
 
Figure 35.2  
, and then create risk infor-
mation sheets for each.    
 
35.11.  Represent three of the risks noted in   
Figure 35.2  
 using a CTC format.    
 
35.12.  Recompute the risk exposure discussed in Section 35.4.2 when cost/LOC is $16 and the probability is 60 percent.    
 
35.13.  Can you think of a situation in which a high-probability, high-impact risk would not 
be considered as part of your RMMM plan?    
 
35.14.  Describe ﬁ ve software application areas in which software safety and hazard analysis 
would be a major concern.

 READINGS AND INFORMATION
 SOURCES  
 
The software risk management literature has expanded signiﬁ cantly over the past few de-
cades. Mun ( Modeling Risk, 
 2nd ed., Wiley, 2010) presents a detailed mathematical treat-
ment of risk analysis that can be applied to software projects. Mulcahy ( Risk Management, Tricks of the Trade for Project Managers,
 
 2nd ed., RMC Publications, 2010), Kendrick ( 
Identi-fying and Managing Project Risk,
 
 2nd ed., American Management Association, 2009), Crohy 
and his colleagues ( The Essentials of Risk Management, 
 McGraw-Hill, 2006), and Marrison 
( The Fundamentals of Risk Measurement,
 
 McGraw-Hill, 2002) present useful methods and 
tools that every project manager can use. Jindal and his colleagues ( Risk Management in Software Engineering,
 
 Create Space Independent Publishing, 2012) discuss embedding se-
curity risk assessment as part system development.  DeMarco and Lister ( Dancing with Bears, 
 Dorset House, 2003) have written an entertain-
ing and insightful book that guides software managers and practitioners through risk man-
agement. Moynihan ( Coping with IT/IS Risk Management, 
 Springer-Verlag, 2002) presents 
pragmatic advice from project managers who deal with risk on a continuing basis. Royer 
( Project Risk Management,
 
 Management Concepts, 2002) and Smith and Merritt ( 
Proactive 
Risk Management, 
 Productivity Press, 2002) suggest a proactive process for risk manage-
ment. Karolak ( Software Engineering Risk Management,
 
 Wiley, 2002) has written a guide-
book that introduces an easy-to-use risk analysis model with worthwhile checklists and 
questionnaires supported by a software package.  Capers Jones ( Assessment and Control of Software Risks,
 
 Prentice Hall, 1994) presents 
a detailed discussion of software risks that includes data collected from hundreds of soft-
ware projects. Jones deﬁ nes 60 risk factors that can affect the outcome of software projects. 
Boehm [Boe89] suggests excellent questionnaire and checklist formats that can prove in-
valuable in identifying risk. Charette [Cha89] presents a detailed treatment of the mechan-
ics of risk analysis, calling on probability theory and statistical techniques to analyze risks. 
In a companion volume, Charette ( Application Strategies for Risk Analysis, 
 McGraw-Hill, 
1990) discusses risk in the context of both system and software engineering and suggests 
pragmatic strategies for risk management. Gilb ( Principles of Software Engineering Man-
agement, 
 Addison-Wesley, 1988) presents a set of “principles” (which are often amusing and 
sometimes profound) that can serve as a worthwhile guide for risk management.   Ewusi-Mensah ( 
Software Development Failures: Anatomy of Abandoned Projects,
 
 MIT 
Press, 2003) and Yourdon ( 
Death March,
 
 Prentice Hall, 1997) discuss what happens when
