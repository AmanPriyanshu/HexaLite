MANAGING SOFTWARE PROJECTS
 
Every system is actually a hierarchy of subsystems. A business is no exception. The overall business is segmented in the following manner:  
 
The business  business systems  business processes  business subprocesses 
 
 
  Each business system (also called  business function 
) is composed of one or more business processes, and each business process is deﬁ ned by a set of subprocesses. 
 BPR can be applied at any level of the hierarchy, but as the scope of BPR 
broadens (i.e., as we move upward in the hierarchy), the risks associated with 
BPR grow dramatically. For this reason, most BPR efforts focus on individual pro-

cesses or subprocesses.

A BPR Model  
Like most engineering activities, business process reengineering is iterative. Business goals and the processes that achieve them must be adapted to a chang-
ing business environment. For this reason, there is no start and end to BPR—it is 
an evolutionary process. A model for business process reengineering is depicted 
in Figure 36.1. The model deﬁ nes six activities: 
  
 
 
 
 
 1.
   
Business deﬁ nition.
 
 Business goals are identiﬁ ed within the context of 
four key drivers: cost reduction, time reduction, quality improvement, and 
personnel development and empowerment. Goals may be deﬁ ned at the 
business level or for a speciﬁ c component of the business. 
  
 
 
 2.
   
Process identiﬁ cation.
 
 Processes that are critical to achieving the goals deﬁ ned in the business deﬁ
 nition are identiﬁ
 ed. They may then be ranked
