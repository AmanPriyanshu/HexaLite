COCOMO II is a freely available model that is supported with open-source tools.COCOMO II was developed from earlier COCOMO (Constructive Cost 
Modeling) cost estimation models, which were largely based on original code devel-
opment (B. W. Boehm 1981; B. Boehm and Royce 1989). The COCOMO II model 

takes into account modern approaches to software development, such as rapid devel
-
opment using dynamic languages, development with reuse, and database program-
ming. COCOMO II embeds several submodels based on these techniques, which 

produce increasingly detailed estimates.The submodels (Figure 23.10) that are part of the COCOMO II model are:1. An application composition model This models the effort required to develop 

systems that are created from reusable components, scripting, or database pro-
gramming. Software size estimates are based on application points, and a simple 

size/productivity formula is used to estimate the effort required.2. An early design model This model is used during early stages of the system 

design after the requirements have been established. The estimate is based on the 

standard estimation formula that I discussed in the introduction of this chapter, 
with a simplified set of seven multipliers. Estimates are based on function points, 

which are then converted to number of lines of source code. Function points are a language-independent way of quantifying program func
-
tionality. You compute the total number of function points in a program by 

measuring or estimating the number of external inputs and outputs, user interac-
tions, external interfaces, and files or database tables used by the system.Number ofapplication pointsNumber of
