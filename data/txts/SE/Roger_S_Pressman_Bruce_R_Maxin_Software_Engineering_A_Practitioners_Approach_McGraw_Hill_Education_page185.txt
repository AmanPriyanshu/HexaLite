Scenario-based elements.   
The system is described from the user’s point of view 
using a scenario-based approach. For example, basic use cases (Section 8.4) and 
their corresponding use case diagrams ( Figure 8.2 ) evolve into more elaborate template-based use cases. Scenario-based elements of the requirements model 
are often the ﬁ rst part of the model that is developed. As such, they serve as input 
for the creation of other modeling elements.  Figure 8.3  depicts a UML activity di-
agram  17 
 
 for eliciting requirements and representing them using use cases. Three 
levels of elaboration are shown, culminating in a scenario-based representation.  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Class-based elements.   
Each usage scenario implies a set of objects that are ma-nipulated as an actor interacts with the system. These objects are categorized 
into classes—a collection of things that have similar attributes and common be-
haviors. For example, a UML class diagram can be used to depict a  Sensor 
 class 
for the  SafeHome 
 security function ( 
Figure 8.4 ). Note that the diagram lists the attributes of sensors (e.g., name, type) and the operations (e.g.,  identify, enable
 
) that can be applied to modify these attributes. In addition to class diagrams, other 
analysis modeling elements depict the manner in which classes collaborate with    One way to isolate 
classes is to look for 
descriptive nouns in a 
use case script. At least 
some of the nouns 
will be candidate 
classes. More on this 
in Chapter 12.   
17  A brief UML tutorial is presented in Appendix 1 for those who are unfamiliar with the notation.
