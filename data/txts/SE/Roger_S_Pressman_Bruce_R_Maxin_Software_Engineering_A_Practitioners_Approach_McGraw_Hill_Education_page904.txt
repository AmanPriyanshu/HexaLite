874 APPENDIX 1  AN INTRODUCTION TO UML  
  DEPLOYMENT DIAGRAMS   
A UML  deployment diagram  focuses on the structure of the software system and is 
useful for showing the physical distribution of a software system among hardware 

platforms and execution environments. Suppose, for example, you are developing 

a Web-based graphics-rendering package. Users of your package will use their 

Web browser to go to your website and enter rendering information. Your website 

would render a graphical image according to the user’s speciﬁ cation and send it 

back to the user. Because graphics rendering can be computationally expensive, 

you decide to move the rendering itself off the Web server and onto a separate 

platform. Therefore, there will be three hardware devices involved in your sys-
tem: the Web client (the users’ computer running a browser), the computer host-
ing the Web server, and the computer hosting the rendering engine. 
   
Figure A1.4 shows the deployment diagram for such a package. In such a dia-gram, hardware components are drawn in boxes labeled with “«device»”. Com-
munication paths between hardware components are drawn with lines with 
optional labels. In   Figure A1.4, the paths are labeled with the communication protocol and the type of network used to connect the devices.  
 Each node in a deployment diagram can also be annotated with details about the device. For example, in   Figure A1.4, the browser client is depicted to show that it contains an artifact consisting of the Web browser software. An artifact 
is typically a ﬁ le containing software running on a device. You can also specify 
tagged values, as is shown in   Figure A1.4 in the Web server node. These values deﬁ ne the vendor of the Web server and the operating system used by the server. 
 Deployment diagrams can also display execution environment nodes, which are 
drawn as boxes containing the label “«execution environment»”. These nodes rep-
resent systems, such as operating systems, that can host other software programs.
