only a single task (T5) in the project. The use of specialists is unavoidable when 
complex systems are being developed, but it can lead to scheduling problems. If one 
project is delayed while a specialist is working on it, this may affect other projects 
where the specialist is also required. These projects may be delayed because the 

specialist is not available.If a task is delayed, later tasks that are dependent on it may be affected. They can
-not start until the delayed task is completed. Delays can cause serious problems with 
staff allocation, especially when people are working on several projects at the same 

time. If a task (T) is delayed, the people allocated to it may be assigned to other work 
(W). To complete this work may take longer than the delay, but, once assigned, they 
cannot simply be reassigned back to the original task. This may then lead to further 
delays in T as they complete W.Normally, you should use a project planning tool, such as the Basecamp or 
Microsoft project, to create, update, and analyze project schedule information. 

Project management tools usually expect you to input project information into a 

table, and they create a database of project information. Bar charts and activity charts 
can then be generated automatically from this database.Week
