COMPONENT-LEVEL DESIGN

Step 5. Develop and elaborate behavioral representations for a class or  component.   UML state diagrams were used as part of the requirements model to represent the externally observable behavior of the system and the more lo-
calized behavior of individual analysis classes. During component-level design, it 
is sometimes necessary to model the behavior of a design class.  The dynamic behavior of an object (an instantiation of a design class as the program executes) is affected by events that are external to it and the current 
state (mode of behavior) of the object. To understand the dynamic behavior of 

an object, you should examine all use cases that are relevant to the design class 
throughout its life. These use cases provide information that helps you to delin-
eate the events that affect the object and the states in which the object resides as 
time passes and events occur. The transitions between states (driven by events) is 

represented using a UML statechart [Ben02] as illustrated in  Figure 14.9 .
