34.6.  The relationship between people and time is highly nonlinear. Using Putnam’s soft-
ware equation (described in Section 34.2.2), develop a table that relates number of people 
to project duration for a software project requiring 50,000 LOC and 15 person-years of effort 
(the productivity parameter is 5000 and  B 
 5 0.37). Assume that the software must be deliv-
ered in 24 months plus or minus 12 months.    
 
34.7.  Assume that you have been contracted by a university to develop an online course reg-istration system (OLCRS). First, act as the customer (if you’re a student, that should be easy) 
and specify the characteristics of a good system. (Alternatively, your instructor will provide 

you with a set of preliminary requirements for the system.) Using the estimation methods 
discussed in Chapter 33, develop an effort and duration estimate for OLCRS. Suggest how 
you would:   
 
 
 a.  
Deﬁ ne parallel work activities during the OLCRS project. 
   
 
 b.  
Distribute effort throughout the project.    
 
 c.  
Establish milestones for the project.  
 
   
 
34.8.  Select an appropriate task set for the OLCRS project.    
 
34.9.  Deﬁ ne a task network for OLCRS described in Problem 34.7, or alternatively, for an-
other software project that interests you. Be sure to show tasks and milestones and to attach 
effort and duration estimates to each task. If possible, use an automated scheduling tool to 
perform this work.    
 
34.10.  If an automated scheduling tool is available, determine the critical path for the net-work deﬁ ned in problem 34.9. 
   
 
34.11.  Using a scheduling tool (if available) or paper and pencil (if necessary), develop a time-line chart for the OLCRS project.    
 
34.12.  Assume you are a software project manager and that you’ve been asked to compute earned value statistics for a small software project. The project has 56 planned work tasks 
that are estimated to require 582 person-days to complete. At the time that you’ve been 
asked to do the earned value analysis, 12 tasks have been completed. However the project 
schedule indicates that 15 tasks should have been completed. The following scheduling data 
(in person-days) are available:TaskPlanned EffortActual Effort
