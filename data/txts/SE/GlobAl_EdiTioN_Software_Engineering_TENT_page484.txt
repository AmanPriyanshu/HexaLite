˚˛˝˙ˆˇ˘˜˜˚˜˜˜˜˜methods here. Rather, I simply show the methods that are needed to illustrate the com-ponent documentation problem. The methods in the interface of Photo Library are:public void addItem (Identifier pid ; Photograph p; CatalogEntry photodesc) ;public Photograph retrieve (Identifier pid) ;
public CatalogEntry catEntry (Identifier pid) ;Assume that the documentation for the addItem method in Photo Library is:This method adds a photograph to the library and associates the photograph identifier and catalog descriptor with the photograph.This description appears to explain what the component does, but consider the 
following questions:˜ What happens if the photograph identifier is already associated with a photograph in the library?˜ Is the photograph descriptor associated with the catalog entry as well as the 
 photograph? That is, if you delete the photograph, do you also delete the catalog 

information?There is not enough information in the informal description of addItem to answer these questions. Of course, it is possible to add more information to the natural lan-guage description of the method, but in general, the best way to resolve ambiguities 
is to use a formal language to describe the interface. The specification shown in 

Figure 16.
14 is part of the description of the interface of Photo Library
 that adds 
information to the informal description.Š The context keyword names the component to which the conditions applycontext addItem
Š The preconditions specify what must be true before execution of addItempre:      PhotoLibrary.libSize() > 0
            
PhotoLibrary.retrieve(pid) = null
Š The postconditions specify what is true after execution
post:    
libSize () = libSize()@pre + 1          PhotoLibrary.retrieve(pid) = p
          PhotoLibrary.catEntry(pid) = photodesc
context deletepre:      PhotoLibrary.retrieve(pid) <> null ;
post:    PhotoLibrary.retrieve(pid) = null
          PhotoLibrary.catEntry(pid) = PhotoLibrary.catEntry(pid)@pre
          PhotoLibrary.libSize() = libSize()@preŠ1
