2. Activity networks show the dependencies between the different activities mak-ing up a project. These networks are described in an associated web section.Project activities are the basic planning element. Each activity has:˜ a duration in calendar days or months;˜ an effort estimate, which shows the number of person-days or person-months to 
complete the work;˜ a deadline by which the activity should be complete; and˜ a defined endpoint, which might be a document, the holding of a review meeting, 
the successful execution of all tests, or the like.When planning a project, you may decide to define project milestones. A mile
-stone is a logical end to a stage of the project where the progress of the work can 
be reviewed. Each milestone should be documented by a brief report (often sim
-ply an email) that summarizes the work done and whether or not the work has 

been completed as planned. Milestones may be associated with a single task or 

with groups of related activities. For example, in Figure 23.5, milestone M1 is 

associated with task T1 and marks the end of that activity. Milestone M3 is asso-ciated with a pair of tasks T2 and T4; there is no individual milestone at the end 

of these tasks.TaskEffort (person-days)Duration (days)
