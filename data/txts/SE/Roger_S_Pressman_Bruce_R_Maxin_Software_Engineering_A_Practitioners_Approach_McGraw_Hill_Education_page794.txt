DEFINING A TASK NETWORK  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Individual tasks and subtasks have interdependencies based on their sequence. In addition, when more than one person is involved in a software engineering 
project, it is likely that development activities and tasks will be performed in 
parallel. When this occurs, concurrent tasks must be coordinated so that they 
will be complete when later tasks require their work product(s).  A  task network, 
 also called an  activity network, 
 is a graphic representation of the task ﬂ ow for a project. It is sometimes used as the mechanism through which 
task sequence and dependencies are input to an automated project scheduling 
tool. In its simplest form (used when creating a macroscopic schedule), the task 
network depicts major software engineering tasks.   
Figure 34.2  
 shows a sche-
matic task network for a concept development project.    
 
 
 
The concurrent nature of software engineering activities leads to a number of important scheduling requirements. Because parallel tasks occur asynchro-
nously, you should determine intertask dependencies to ensure continuous 

progress toward completion. In addition, you should be aware of those tasks that 
lie on the  critical path. 
 That is, tasks that must be completed on schedule if the 
project as a whole is to be completed on schedule. These issues are discussed in 
more detail later in this chapter. 
 It is important to note that the task network shown in   
Figure 34.2  
 is macro-
scopic. In a detailed task network (a precursor to a detailed schedule), each ac-
tivity shown in the ﬁ gure would be expanded. For example, Task 1.1 would be 
expanded to show all tasks detailed in the reﬁ nement of Tasks 1.1 shown in Sec-
tion 34.3.2.    The task network is 
a useful mechanism 
for depicting intertask 

dependencies and 
determining the critical 

path. I.1ConceptscopingI.2ConceptplanningI.3bTech. risk
