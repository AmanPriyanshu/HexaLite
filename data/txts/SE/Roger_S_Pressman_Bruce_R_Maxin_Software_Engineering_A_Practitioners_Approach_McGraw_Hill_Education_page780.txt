cost $450,000. A “simple” development effort is estimated to cost $380,000. The expected value for cost, computed along any branch of the decision tree, isExpected cost 5 S (path probability) i

 is the decision tree path. For the build path,Expected costbuild 5 0.30 ($380K) 1 0.70 ($450K) 5 $429K  Following other paths of the decision tree, the projected costs for reuse, purchase, and contract, under a variety of circumstances, are also shown. The 
expected costs for these paths areExpected costreuse 5 0.40 ($275K) 1 0.60 [0.20 ($310K) 1 0.80 ($490K)] 5 $382KExpected costbuy 5 0.70 ($210K) 1 0.30 ($400K) 5 $267KExpected costcontract 5 0.60 ($350K) 1 0.40 ($500K) 5 $410K  Based on the probability and projected costs that have been noted in   
Figure 33.5  
, the lowest expected cost is the “buy” option.  It is important to note, however, that many criteria—not just cost— must be 
considered during the decision-making process. Availability, experience of the 

developer/vendor/contractor, conformance to requirements, local “politics,” 

and the likelihood of change are but a few of the criteria that may affect the ulti-
mate decision to build, reuse, buy, or contract.

Outsourcing 
 
Sooner or later, every company that develops computer software asks a funda-
mental question: “Is there a way that we can get the software and systems we 
need at a lower price?” The answer to this question is not a simple one, and the 
emotional discussions that occur in response to the question always lead to a 
single word:  outsourcing.
 
  In concept, outsourcing is extremely simple. Software engineering activities are contracted to a third party who does the work at lower cost and, hopefully, 

higher quality. Software work conducted within a company is reduced to a con-

tract management activity.

  The decision to outsource can be either strategic or tactical. At the strategic level, business managers consider whether a signiﬁ cant portion of all software 
work can be contracted to others. At the tactical level, a project manager deter-

mines whether part or all of a project can be best accomplished by subcontract-
ing the software work.   
 
 uote:  “As a rule 
outsourcing 
requires even 
more skillful 
management 
than in-house 
development.”  Steve McConnell

ware or software components from a source outside the software engineering organization. pre22126_ch33_727-753.indd   750pre22126_ch33_727-753.indd   75013/12/13   6:17 PM13/12/13   6:17 PM
