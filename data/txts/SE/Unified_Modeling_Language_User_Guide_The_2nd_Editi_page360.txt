  Extensibility The UML provides three mechanisms for extending the language's syntax and semantics: stereotypes (which represent new modeling elements), tagged values (which represent new modeling attributes), and constraints (which represent new modeling semantics).  Diagrams A diagram is the graphical presentation of a set of elements, most often rendered as a connected graph of vertices (things) and arcs (relationships). A diagram is a projection into a system. The UML includes nine such diagrams. 1. Class diagram  A structural diagram that shows a set of classes, interfaces, collaborations, and their relationships 2. Object diagram  A structural diagram that shows a set of objects and their relationships 3. Use case diagram  A behavioral diagram that shows a set of use cases and actors and their relationships 4. Sequence diagram  A behavioral diagram that shows an interaction, emphasizing the time ordering of messages 5. Collaboration diagram  A behavioral diagram that shows an interaction, emphasizing the structural organization of the objects that send and receive messages 6. Statechart diagram  A behavioral diagram that shows a state machine, emphasizing the event-ordered behavior of an object 7. Activity diagram  A behavioral diagram that shows a state machine, emphasizing the flow from activity to activity 8. Component diagram  A structural diagram that shows a set of components and their relationships
