Figure 14.9  Resilience engineering 2. It assumes that there is a detailed requirements statement for a system. In fact, resilience may have to be ﬁretrofittedﬂ to a system where there is no complete or 
up-to-date requirements document. For new systems, resilience may itself be a 
requirement, or systems may be developed using an agile approach. The system 
architecture may be designed to take resilience into account.A more general resilience engineering method, as shown in Figure 
14.9, takes the lack of detailed requirements into account as well as explicitly designing recovery 
and reinstatement into the system. For the majority of components in a system, you 
will not have access to their source code and will not be able to make changes to 

them. Your strategy for resilience has to be designed with this limitation in mind.There are five interrelated streams of work in this approach to resilience engineering:1. You identify business resilience requirements. These requirements set out how 
the business as a whole must maintain the services that it delivers to customers 
and, from this, resilience requirements for individual systems are developed. 

Providing resilience is expensive, and it is important not to overengineer sys
-
tems with unnecessary resilience support.2. You plan how to reinstate a system or a set of systems to their normal operating 

state after an adverse event. This plan has to be integrated with the business™s
