DESIGN CONCEPTS 243 
But if design comes ﬁ rst, then the design (and code) must be developed with 
 seams 
—locations in the detailed design where you can “insert test code that probes the state of your running software” and/or “isolate code under test from 
its production environment so that you can exercise it in a controlled testing 
context” [Wir09]. 
 Sometimes referred to as “test hooks,” seams must be consciously designed at the component level. To accomplish this, a designer must give thought to the 

tests that will be conducted to exercise the component. As Wirfs-Brock states: “In 

short, you need to provide appropriate test affordances—factoring your design in 
a way that lets test code interrogate and control the running system.”

HE DESIGN MODEL  
 
The design model can be viewed in two different dimensions as illustrated in  Figure 12.4 . The  process dimension
 
 indicates the evolution of the design model 
as design tasks are executed as part of the software process. The  abstraction dimension 
 represents the level of detail as each element of the analysis model 
is transformed into a design equivalent and then reﬁ ned iteratively. Referring to 
the ﬁ gure, the dashed line indicates the boundary between the analysis and de-
sign models. In some cases, a clear distinction between the analysis and design Process dimension
