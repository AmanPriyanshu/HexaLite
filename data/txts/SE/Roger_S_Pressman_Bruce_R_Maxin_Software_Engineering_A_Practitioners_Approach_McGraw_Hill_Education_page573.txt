These ﬁ ve error attributes suggest that environment plays an important role 
in the diagnosis of all errors uncovered during the WebApp testing. In some sit-

uations (e.g., content testing), the site of the error is obvious, but in many other 
types of WebApp testing (e.g., navigation testing, performance testing, security 

testing) the underlying cause of the error may be considerably more difﬁ cult to 
determine.

Testing Strategy 
 
The strategy for WebApp testing adopts the basic principles for all software test-
ing (Chapter 22) and applies a strategy and tactics that have been recommended 
for object-oriented systems (Chapter 24). The following steps summarize the 
approach:   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1.
  The content model for the WebApp is reviewed to uncover errors. 
  
 
 
 2.
  The interface model is reviewed to ensure that all use cases can be accommodated.   
 
 
 3.
  The design model for the WebApp is reviewed to uncover navigation 
errors.   
 
 
 4.
  The user interface is tested to uncover errors in presentation and/or navigation mechanics.   
 
 
 5.
  Selected functional components are unit tested.   
 
 
 6.
  Navigation throughout the architecture is tested.   
 
 
 7.
  The WebApp is implemented in a variety of different environmental 
conﬁ gurations and is tested for compatibility with each conﬁ
 guration. 
  
 
 
 8.
  Security tests are conducted in an attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the WebApp or within its environment. 
  
 
 
 9.
  Performance tests are conducted.   
 
 
 10.
  The WebApp is tested by a controlled and monitored population of 
end users; the results of their interaction with the system are 
evaluated for content and navigation errors, usability concerns, 
compatibility concerns, and WebApp security, reliability, and 

performance.  
 
 
 
 
   
Because many WebApps evolve continuously, the testing process is an ongoing 
activity, conducted by Web support staff who use regression tests derived from 

the tests developed when the WebApp was ﬁ
 rst engineered.

Test Planning 
 
The use of the word  planning 
 (in any context) is anathema to some Web devel-
opers. These developers don’t plan; they just start—hoping that a killer WebApp

WebApp testing can be
