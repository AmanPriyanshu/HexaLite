246 PART TWO  
MODELING 
 
The design of internal interfaces is closely aligned with component-level de-sign (Chapter 14). Design realizations of analysis classes represent all operations 
and the messaging schemes required to enable communication and collabora-
tion between operations in various classes. Each message must be designed to 
accommodate the requisite information transfer and the speciﬁ c functional re-
quirements of the operation that has been requested.   
In some cases, an interface is modeled in much the same way as a class. In UML, an interface is deﬁ ned in the following manner [OMG03a]: “An interface 
is a speciﬁ er for the externally-visible [public] operations of a class, component, 
or other classiﬁ er (including subsystems) without speciﬁ
 cation of internal struc-
ture.” Stated more simply, an interface is a set of operations that describes some 

part of the behavior of a class and provides access to these operations.  
  For example, the  SafeHome 
 security function makes use of a control panel 
that allows a homeowner to control certain aspects of the security function. In an 
advanced version of the system, control panel functions may be implemented via 
a mobile platform (e.g., smartphone or tablet).  The  ControlPanel 
 class ( 
Figure 12.5 ) provides the behavior associated with a keypad, and therefore, it must implement the operations  readKeyStroke ()
 
 and 
 decodeKey () 
. If these operations are to be provided to other classes (in this case,  Tablet
 
 and  
SmartPhone 
), it is useful to deﬁ ne an interface as shown in the ﬁ
 gure. 
The interface, named  KeyPad 
, is shown as an <<interface>> stereotype or as a small, labeled circle connected to the class with a line. The interface is deﬁ ned 
with no attributes and the set of operations that are necessary to achieve the 
behavior of a keypad.  WebRef

 uote:  “Every now and 
then go away, have 

a little relaxation, 
for when you come 
back to your work 
your judgment 
will be surer. Go 

some distance 
away because then 
the work appears 
smaller and more 
of it can be taken 
in at a glance and 
a lack of harmony 
and proportion 
is more readily 
seen.”  Leonardo
