1  A s he ﬁ nished showing me the latest build of one of the world’s 
most popular ﬁ rst-person shooter video games, the young developer 
laughed. 
  
“You’re not a gamer, are you?” he asked. 
 I smiled. “How’d you guess?”   
The young man was dressed in shorts and a tee shirt. His leg bounced up and down like a piston, burning the nervous energy that seemed to be com-
monplace among his co-workers.   
“Because if you were,” he said, “you’d be a lot more excited. You’ve gotten a 
peek at our next generation product and that’s something that our customers 

 
 no pun intended.”   
We sat in a development area at one of the most successful game develop-
ers on the planet. Over the years, earlier generations of the game he demoed 
sold over 50 million copies and generated billions of dollars in revenue.   
“So, when will this version be on the market?” I asked.  He shrugged. “In about ﬁ ve months, and we’ve still got a lot of work to do.” 
  
He had responsibility for game play and artiﬁ cial intelligence functionality 
in an application that encompassed more than three million lines of code.   
“Do you guys use any software engineering techniques?” I asked, half-expecting that he’d laugh and shake his head.

 THE NATURE
 OF SOFTWARE
 1  
 
 
CHAPTER 
 
What is it?   
Computer software is the product that software profession-
als build and then support over the 

long term. It encompasses programs 
that execute within a computer of any size and 
architecture, content that is presented as the 
computer programs execute, and descriptive 
information in both hard copy and virtual forms 

that encompass virtually any electronic media. 
  
 
Who does it?   
Software engineers build and support software, and virtually everyone in 

the industrialized world uses it either directly 
or indirectly. 
  
 
Why is it important? 
  
Software is important 
because it affects nearly every aspect of our 

lives and has become pervasive in our com-

merce, our culture, and our everyday activities. 
  
 
What are the steps?   
Customers and other stakeholders express the need for computer 
software, engineers build the software prod-
uct, and end users apply the software to solve 
a speciﬁ c problem or to address a speciﬁ
 c 
need.   
 
What is the work product? 
  
A computer pro-gram that runs in one or more speciﬁ c environ-
ments and services the needs of one or more 

end users.   
 
How do I ensure that I’ve done it 
right?   
If you’re a software engineer, apply 
the ideas contained in the remainder of this 

book. If you’re an end user, be sure you un-

derstand your need and your environment 

and then select an application that best 

meets them both.
