QUALITY MANAGEMENTand is supported by tools that enable the content author to characterize content in a manner that can be standardized for use within the Web or MobileApp. 
 Once content exists, it must be converted to conform to the requirements of a CMS. This implies stripping raw content of any unnecessary information (e.g., 
redundant graphical representations), formatting the content to conform to the 
requirements of the CMS, and mapping the results into an information structure 
that will enable it to be managed and published.   
 
 
 
The management subsystem.   
Once content exists, it must be stored in a re-pository, cataloged for subsequent acquisition and use, and labeled to deﬁ
 ne 
current status (e.g., is the content object complete or in development?), (2) the 

appropriate version of the content object, and (3) related content objects. There-
fore, the  management subsystem 
 implements a repository that encompasses the 
following elements:  
 
 
•   
Content database 
—The information structure that has been established to store all content objects.   
 
 
•   
Database capabilities 
—Functions that enable the CMS to search for spe-ciﬁ c content objects (or categories of objects), store and retrieve objects, 
and manage the ﬁ le structure that has been established for the content. 
  
 
 
•   
Conﬁ guration management functions
 
—The functional elements and asso-ciated workﬂ ow that support content object identiﬁ
 cation, version control, 
change management, change auditing, and reporting.     The management 
subsystem implements 
a repository for all 

content. Conﬁ guration 

management is 
performed within this 

subsystem. DatabaseTemplates
