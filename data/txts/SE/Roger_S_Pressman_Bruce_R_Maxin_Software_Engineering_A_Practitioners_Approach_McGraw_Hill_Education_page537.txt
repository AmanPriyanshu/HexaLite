TESTING CONVENTIONAL APPLICATIONS
 507matrix can become a powerful tool for evaluating program control structure during testing. The link weight provides additional information about control 
ﬂ ow. In its simplest form, the link weight is 1 (a connection exists) or 0 (a connec-
tion does not exist). But link weights can be assigned other, more interesting 

properties:  
 
 
•  The probability that a link (edge) will be executed.   
 
 
•  The processing time expended during traversal of a link   
 
 
•  The memory required during traversal of a link   
 
 
•  The resources required during traversal of a link.  
 
  Beizer [Bei90] provides a thorough treatment of additional mathematical algorithms that can be applied to graph matrices. Using these techniques, the 
analysis required to design test cases can be partially or fully automated.

CONTROL STRUCTURE TESTING  
 
The basis path testing technique described in Section 23.4 is one of a number of techniques for control structure testing. Although basis path testing is simple 
and highly effective, it is not sufﬁ cient in itself. In this section, other variations 
on control structure testing are discussed. These broaden testing coverage and 
improve the quality of white-box testing.   
Condition testing 
 [Tai89] is a test-case design method that exercises the logical 
conditions contained in a program module.  Data ﬂ ow testing
 
 [Fra93] selects test 
paths of a program according to the locations of deﬁ nitions and uses of variables 
in the program.   
Loop testing 
 is a white-box testing technique that focuses exclusively on the va-
lidity of loop constructs. Four different classes of loops [Bei90] can be deﬁ ned: sim-
ple loops, concatenated loops, nested loops, and unstructured loops ( Figure 23.7 ). 
 
 
 
 uote:  “Paying more 
attention to 
running tests 
than to designing 
them is a classic 
mistake.”  Brian Marick
