These key features are enough to describe most workflows. However, BPMN 
includes many additional features that I don™t have space to describe here. These add 
information to a business process description that allows it to be automatically trans
-
lated into an executable service.
Figure 18.
15 shows a process that is enacted in a single organization, the com
-pany that provides a booking service. However, the key benefit of a service-oriented 

approach is that it supports interorganizational computing. This means that a compu
-
tation involves processes and services in different companies. This process is repre
-
sented in BPMN by developing separate workflows for each of the organizations 

involved with interactions between them.
To illustrate multiple workflow processes, I use a different example, drawn 
from high-performance computing, where hardware is offered as a service. 

Services are created to provide access to high-performance computers to a geo
-
graphically distributed user community. In this example, a vector-processing com
-
puter (a machine that can carry out parallel computations on arrays of values) is 

offered as a service (
VectorProcService
) by a research laboratory. This is accessed 
through another service called SetupComputation. These services and their 
 interactions are shown in Figure 
18.16.In this example, the workflow for the 
SetupComputation service asks for access 
to a vector processor and, if a processor is available, establishes the computation 

required and downloads data to the processing service. Once the computation is 

complete, the results are stored on the local computer. The workflow for 
VectorProcService
 includes the following steps:
Check if a processor is available
Allocate resources for the computation
