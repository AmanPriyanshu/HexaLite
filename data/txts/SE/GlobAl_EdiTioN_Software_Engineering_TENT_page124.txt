˜more effectively. However, it is still sometimes difficult to write requirements in a 
clear and unambiguous way, particularly when complex computations (e.g., how to 

calculate the insulin dose) are to be specified.To address this problem, you can add extra information to natural language 
requirements, for example, by using tables or graphical models of the system. These 

can show how computations proceed, how the system state changes, how users inter-
act with the system, and how sequences of actions are performed.Tables are particularly useful when there are a number of possible alternative 
situations and you need to describe the actions to be taken for each of these. The 

insulin pump bases its computations of the insulin requirement on the rate of change 
of blood sugar levels. The rates of change are computed using the current and previ-
ous readings. Figure 4.14 is a tabular description of how the rate of change of blood 
sugar is used to calculate the amount of insulin to be delivered.Figure 4.14 The  tabular specification

Computes the dose of insulin to be delivered when the current measured sugar level is in the safe zone between 3 and 7 units.Inputs Current sugar reading (r2), the previous two readings (r0 and r1).Source Current sugar reading from sensor. Other readings from memory.Outputs CompDoseŠthe dose in insulin to be delivered.Destination Main control loop.Action:  
CompDose is zero if the sugar level is stable or falling or if the level is increasing but the rate of 
increase is decreasing. If the level is increasing and the rate of increase is increasing, then 
CompDose is computed by dividing the difference between the current sugar level and the 
previous level by 4 and rounding the result. If the result, is rounded to zero then CompDose is 
set to the minimum dose that can be delivered. (see Figure 4.14)Requires Two previous readings so that the rate of change of sugar level can be computed.Precondition The insulin reservoir contains at least the maximum allowed single dose of insulin.Postcondition r0 is replaced by r1 then r1 is replaced by r2.Side effects None.
