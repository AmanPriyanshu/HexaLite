9.3.2 Swimlane Diagrams 
 
The UML  swimlane diagram 
 is a useful variation of the activity diagram and al-
lows you to represent the ﬂ ow of activities described by the use case and at the 
same time indicate which actor (if there are multiple actors involved in a speciﬁ c 
use case) or analysis class (Chapter 10) has responsibility for the action described 
by an activity rectangle. Responsibilities are represented as parallel segments 
that divide the diagram vertically, like the lanes in a swimming pool. 
 
 
 
   
Three analysis classes— Homeowner, Camera,
 
 and 
 Interface
 
—have direct or indirect responsibilities in the context of the activity diagram represented 
in  Figure 9.5 . Referring to  Figure 9.6 , the activity diagram is rearranged so that    A UML swimlane 
diagram represents the 
ﬂ ow of actions and 

decisions and indicates 
which actors perform 

each. Enter password and user IDSelect major functionValid passwords/ID
