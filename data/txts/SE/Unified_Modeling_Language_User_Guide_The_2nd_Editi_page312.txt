A collaboration may realize any kind of classifier, including classes, use cases, interfaces, components, and nodes. A collaboration that models a mechanism of the system may also stand alone, therefore its context is the system as a whole.  Second, there is the relationship among collaborations. Collaborations may refine other collaborations, and you also model this relationship as a refinement. The refinement relationships among collaborations typically mirror the refinement relationships among the use cases they represent. Figure 27-4 illustrates these two kinds of relationships. Figure 27-4 Organizing Collaborations  Packages are discussed in Chapter 12. Note Collaborations, like any other modeling element in the UML, may be grouped into larger packages. Typically, you'll only need to do this for very large systems. Common Modeling Techniques Modeling the Realization of a Use Case Use cases are discussed in Chapter 16.
