emergent propertyA property that only becomes apparent once all of the components of the system have been integrated to create the system.Enterprise Java Beans (EJB)A Java-based component model.enterprise resource planning (ERP) systemA large-scale software system that includes a range of capabilities to support the 
operation of business enterprises and which provides a means of sharing informa-
tion across these capabilities. For example, an ERP system may include support for 
supply chain management, manufacturing and distribution. ERP systems are con-
figured to the requirements of each company using the system.ethnographyAn observational technique that may be used in requirements elicitation and analy-
sis. The ethnographer immerses him or herself in the users™ environment and 
observes their day-to-day work habits. Requirements for software support can be 
inferred from these observations.event-based systemsSystems where the control of operation is determined by events that are generated 
in the system™s environment. Most real-time systems are event-based systems.extreme programming (XP)A widely-used agile method of software development that includes practices such 
as scenario-based requirements, test-first development and pair programming.fault avoidanceDeveloping software in such a way that faults are not introduced into that software.fault detectionThe use of processes and run-time checking to detect and remove faults in a  program before these result in a system failure.fault toleranceThe ability of a system to continue in execution even after faults have occurred.fault-tolerant architecturesSystem architectures that are designed to allow recovery from software faults. 
These are based on redundant and diverse software components.formal methodsMethods of software development where the software is modeled using formal math-
ematical constructs such as predicates and sets. Formal transformation  converts this 
model to code. Mostly used in the specification and development of critical systems.Gantt chartSee bar chart.
