 know what the next wall will be?   
Ed:  Good question, but as they say, that’s a design 
  
Jamie:  
ﬁ gured it out. 
  
Ed (smiling sheepishly):  True, I’m gonna use a list 
structure which I’ll model when we get to design. If you 
get religious about separating analysis and design, the 
level of detail I have right here could be suspect.   
Jamie:  Looks pretty good to me, but I have a few 
more questions. 
 (Jamie asks questions which result in minor modiﬁ cations.) 
  
Vinod:  Do you have CRC cards for each of the 
 objects? If so, we ought to role-play through them, just to make sure nothing has been omitted.   
Ed:  I’m not quite sure how to do them. 
  
Vinod:  It’s not hard and they really pay off. I’ll show 
you.  FloorPlandetermineType( ) positionFloorplan( )
