MODELINGa shorthand version of the use case. It represents key classes and the events that cause behavior to ﬂ ow from class to class. 
  
 
Figure 11.2  illustrates a partial sequence diagram for the  
SafeHome 
 security 
function. Each of the arrows represents an event (derived from a use case) and 
indicates how the event channels behavior between  SafeHome 
 objects. Time is 
measured vertically (downward), and the narrow vertical rectangles represent 
time spent in processing an activity. States may be shown along a vertical time 

line.  The ﬁ rst event,  
system ready
 
, is derived from the external environment and channels behavior to the  Homeowner 
 object. The homeowner enters a password. 
A  request lookup
 
 event is passed to  
System, 
 which looks up the password in a 
simple database and returns a  result
 
 ( 
found 
 or  
not found 
) to  ControlPanel 
 (now 
in the  comparing 
 state). A valid password results in a  
password
=correct
 
 event 
to  System, 
 which activates  
Sensors 
 with a  
request activation
 
 event. Ultimately, 
control is passed back to the homeowner with the  activation successful 
 event.  Once a complete sequence diagram has been developed, all of the events that cause transitions between system objects can be collated into a set of input 
events and output events (from an object). This information is useful in the cre-
ation of an effective design for the system to be built. Control panelSystemSystem readyReadingRequest lookupComparingResultPassword enteredPassword = correctRequest activationActivation successfulLockedSelectingTimer > lockedTime
