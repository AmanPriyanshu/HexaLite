 3.
  For each operation in the server object (that has been invoked by messages 
sent from the client object), determine the messages that it transmits. 
  
 
 
 4.
  For each of the messages, determine the next level of operations that are invoked and incorporate these into the test sequence.  
 
  To illustrate [Kir94], consider a sequence of operations for the  
Bank 
 class rel-
ative to an  ATM
 
 class ( Figure 24.2 ):verifyAcct•verifyPIN•[[verifyPolicy•withdrawReq]|depositReq|acctInfoREQ]  n 
 
  
A random test case for the  Bank 
 class might be  
 
 
 
 
 
Test case r
3 
 5 verifyAcct•verifyPIN•depositReq 
 
 
  In order to consider the collaborators involved in this test, the messages asso-ciated with each of the operations noted in test case  r3 
 are considered.  
Bank 
 must 
collaborate with  ValidationInfo
 
 to execute the  
verifyAcct() 
 and  
verifyPIN(). 
 
 Bank 
 must collaborate with  Account 
 to execute  
depositReq(). 
 Hence, a new test case 
that exercises these collaborations is   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Test case r
4 
 = verifyAcct [Bank:validAcctValidationInfo]•verifyPIN
[Bank: validPinValidationInfo]•depositReq [Bank: depositaccount] 
  
 
The approach for multiple class partition testing is similar to the approach used for partition testing of individual classes. A single class is partitioned as dis-
cussed in Section 24.5.2. However, the test sequence is expanded to include those 

operations that are invoked via messages to collaborating classes. An alternative ATM
