 Operations You can further specify the implementation of anoperation by using a note, as described in Chapter 6, or by using an activity diagram, as discussed in Chapter 19. An operation is the implementation of a service that can be requested from any object of the class to affect behavior. In other words, an operation is an abstraction of something you can do to an object and that is shared by all objects of that class. A class may have any number of operations or no operations at all. For example, in a windowing library such as the one found in Java's awt package, all objects of the class Rectangle can be moved, resized, or queried for their properties. Often (but not always), invoking an operation on an object changes the object's data or state. Graphically, operations are listed in a compartment just below the class attributes. Operations may be drawn showing only their names, as in Figure 4-5. Figure 4-5 Operations  Note An operation name may be text, just like a class name. In practice, an operation name is a short verb or verb phrase that represents some behavior of its enclosing class. Typically, you capitalize the first letter of every word in an operation name except the first letter, as in move or isEmpty.
