· Is functionally, logically, and physically cohesive. · Can be decomposed into nearly independent subsystems that themselves are systems at a lower level of abstraction. · Can be visualized, specified, constructed, and documented via a set of interrelated, nonoverlapping models. Models have no special graphical representation in the UML (other than rendering them as stereotyped package icons), although you'll typically find them represented in tools as packages, each of which represents a partitioning of the elements of a system from a particular point of view.
