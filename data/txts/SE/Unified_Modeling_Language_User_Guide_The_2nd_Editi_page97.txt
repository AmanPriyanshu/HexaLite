Building software has much the same characteristics except that, given the fluidity of software, you have the ability to define your own basic building blocks from scratch. With the UML, you use class diagrams to visualize the static aspects of these building blocks and their relationships and to specify their details for construction, as you can see in Figure 8-1. Figure 8-1 A Class Diagram  Terms and Concepts A class diagram is a diagram that shows a set of classes, interfaces, and collaborations and their relationships. Graphically, a class diagram is a collection of vertices and arcs. Common Properties The general properties of diagrams are discussed in Chapter 7. A class diagram is just a special kind of diagram and shares the same common properties as do all other diagrams# a name and graphical content that are a projection into a model. What distinguishes a class diagram from all other kinds of diagrams is its particular content.
