WEBAPP DESIGN 385a corporate database, as part of a local data store, or as a collection of indepen-dent ﬁ les. The data developed by the model must be formatted and organized 
by the appropriate view object and then transmitted from the application server 
back to the client-based browser for display on the customer’s machine. 
 In many cases, WebApp architecture is deﬁ
 ned within the context of the de-
velopment environment in which the application is to be implemented. If you 
have further interest, see [Fow03] for a discussion of development environments 
and their role in the design of Web application architectures.

NAVIGATION
 DESIGN  
 
Once the WebApp architecture has been established and the components (pages, 
scripts, applets, and other processing functions) of the architecture have been 
identiﬁ ed, you must deﬁ
 ne navigation pathways that enable users to access 
WebApp content and functions. To accomplish this, identify the semantics of nav-

igation for different users of the site, and deﬁ ne the mechanics (syntax) of achiev-
ing the navigation.   
17.8.1  Navigation Semantics 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Like many WebApp design actions, navigation design begins with a consider-
ation of the user hierarchy and related use cases (Chapter 9) developed for each 
category of user (actor). Each actor may use the WebApp somewhat differently 

and therefore have different navigation requirements. In addition, the use cases 
developed for each actor will deﬁ ne a set of classes that encompass one or more
