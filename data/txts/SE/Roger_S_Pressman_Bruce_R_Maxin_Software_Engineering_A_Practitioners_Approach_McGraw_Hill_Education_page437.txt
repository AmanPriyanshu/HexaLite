THE APPLICABILITY OF CONVENTIONAL SOFTWARE
 ENGINEERING  
 
There are no guarantees that a desktop program or a WebApp can be easily 
adapted for implementation as a MobileApp. However, many of the agile soft-

ware engineering practices (Chapter 5) used to create desktop computer appli-
cations can be used to create standalone MobileApps or mobile client software, 
and many of the practices used to create quality WebApps apply to the creation 

of Web services used by MobileApps. 
 During formulation a set of goals and user stories are assembled following practices used in many agile process models. These will deﬁ ne the required user 
experience and determine stakeholder needs that must be satisﬁ ed and the con-
textual variables that must be taken into account by the MobileApp. The role of 
context and location awareness is not likely to be considered when establishing 
goals for a desktop or Web application. 
 During the planning activity, the difﬁ
 culties of developing for more than one 
device or platform must be factored into the project budget and timeline so that 
the resources needed to satisfy all stakeholder concerns are appropriately al-
located. The difﬁ culties of conducting meaningful usability testing and ade-
quate ﬁ eld testing add to the development costs of MobileApps. Risk analysis 
should consider the impact of losses if security incidents or privacy violations 
occur. Planning for a security review of the requirements might also be desirable 

(Chapter 27).  In MobileApp development, time to market is critical. In addition,  new 
technology elements and changing user requirements are often introduced as 
development proceeds. As we noted earlier, an iterative agile process model 

(Chapters 4 and 5) provides opportunities for developers to make adjustments to 
requirements based on assessments of the evolving product prototype.  During product engineering, content analysis and design are similar to ac-tions applied when a WebApp (Chapter 17) is built. The content to be included in 

the MobileApp needs to be selected and chunked subject to the limitations of the 
targeted devices and platforms.  Design of the MobileApp can be expedited by using rapidly expanding set de-sign patterns (Chapter 13) and component-based design (Chapter 14) oriented 
toward MobileApps [Mes08].  A composition strategy using component-based 

and object-oriented design is applied when existing services are incorporated 
into a MobileApp. Reuse without compromising the quality of services is a core 
objective in MobileApp development [Zha05].  User interface design draws heavily on the lessons learned in the graphic 
and aesthetic design for Web pages (Chapter 17) to support the branding goals 

for the MobileApp. User-centered design, with its emphasis on usability and 

accessibility is important to creating quality user interfaces for MobileApps 

(Chapter 15).
