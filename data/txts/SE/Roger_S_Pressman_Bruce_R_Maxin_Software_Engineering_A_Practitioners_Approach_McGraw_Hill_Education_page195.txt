Use case modeling is often the driver for the creation of all other aspects of the analysis model. The subject is discussed at length by Rosenberg and Stephens ( Use Case Driven Object Modeling with UML: Theory and Practice, 
 Apress, 2007), Denny ( Succeeding with Use Cases: Working Smart to Deliver Quality,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 2005), Alexander and Maiden 
(eds.) ( Scenarios, Stories, Use Cases: Through the Systems Development Life-Cycle,
 
 Wiley, 
2004), Lefﬁ ngwell and his colleagues ( 
Managing Software Requirements: A Use Case Ap-
proach,
 
 2nd ed., Addison-Wesley, 2003) present a useful collection of requirement best 
practices.   
 
A discussion of agile requirements can be found in books by Adzic ( Speciﬁ cation by 
Example: How Successful Teams Deliver the Right Software,
 
 Manning Publications, 2011), 
Lefﬁ ngwell ( 
Agile Requirements: Lean Requirements for Teams, Programs, and Enterprises,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 2011), Cockburn ( 
Agile Software Development: The Cooperative Game,
 
 2nd 
ed., Addison-Wesley, 2006), and Cohn ( 
User Stories Applied: For Agile Software Development,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 2004). 
  
 
A wide variety of information sources on requirements engineering and analysis is avail-able on the Internet. An up-to-date list of World Wide Web references that are relevant to 

requirements engineering and analysis can be found at the SEPA website:
