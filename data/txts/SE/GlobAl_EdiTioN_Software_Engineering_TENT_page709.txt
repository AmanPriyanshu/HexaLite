been followed. The company quality manual should describe the relevant processes and the process data that has to be collected and maintained.The ISO 9001 standard does not define or prescribe the specific quality processes that a company should use. To be conformant with ISO 9001, a company must define 
the types of process shown in Figure 24.5 and have procedures in place demonstrat-
ing that its quality processes are being followed. This allows flexibility across indus-
trial sectors and company sizes.Quality standards can be defined that are appropriate for the type of software 
being developed. Small companies can have simple processes without much docu-
mentation and still be ISO 9001 compliant. However, this flexibility means that you 
cannot make assumptions about the similarities or differences between the processes 
in different ISO 9001Œcompliant companies. Some companies may have very rigid 
quality processes that keep detailed records while others may be much less formal, 

with minimal additional documentation.The relationships between ISO 9001, organizational quality manuals, and indi-vidual project quality plans are shown in Figure 
24.6. This diagram has been adapted 

from a model given by Ince (Ince 1994), who explains how the general ISO 9001 
standard can be used as a basis for software quality management processes. Bamford 
and Deibler (Bamford and Deibler 2003) explain how the later ISO 9001: 2000 

standard can be applied in software companies.Some software customers demand that their suppliers be ISO 9001 certified. The 
customers can then be confident that the software development company has an 

approved quality management system in place. Independent accreditation authorities 
examine the quality management processes and process documentation and decide if 
these processes cover all of the areas specified in ISO 9001. If so, they certify that a 
company™s quality processes, as defined in the quality manual, conform to the ISO 
9001 standard.Some people mistakenly think that ISO 9001 certification means that the quality of the software produced by certified companies will always be better than that from BusinessacquisitionDesign anddevelopmentTestProduction anddeliveryService andsupport
