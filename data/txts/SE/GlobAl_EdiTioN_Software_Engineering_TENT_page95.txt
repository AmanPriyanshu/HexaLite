Dean Leffingwell, who has a great deal of experience in scaling agile methods, 
has developed the Scaled Agile Framework (Leffingwell 2007, 2011) to support 
large-scale, multi-team software development. He reports how this method has been 
used successfully in a number of large companies. IBM has also developed a frame
-
work for the large-scale use of agile methods called the Agile Scaling Model (ASM). 

Figure 3.
14, taken from Ambler™s white paper that discusses ASM (Ambler 2010), 
shows an overview of this model.The ASM recognizes that scaling is a staged process where development teams move from the core agile practices discussed here to what is called Disciplined Agile 
Delivery. Essentially, this stage involves adapting these practices to a disciplined 

organizational setting and recognizing that teams cannot simply focus on develop-
ment but must also take into account other stages of the software engineering 
 process, such as requirements and architectural design.The final scaling stage in ASM is to move to Agility at Scale where the com-plexity that is inherent in large projects is recognized. This involves taking account 

of factors such as distributed development, complex legacy environments, and 

regulatory compliance requirements. The practices used for disciplined agile 

delivery may have to be modified on a project-by-project basis to take these into 

account and, sometimes, additional plan-based practices added to the process.No single model is appropriate for all large-scale agile products as the type of 
product, the customer requirements, and the people available are all different.
