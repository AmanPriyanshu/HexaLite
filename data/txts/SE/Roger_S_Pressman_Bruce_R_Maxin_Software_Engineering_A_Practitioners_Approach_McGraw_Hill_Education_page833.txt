MAINTENANCE AND REENGINEERING 803 
 
 
•  If you decide to rebuild, be disciplined about it. Use practices that will re-sult in high quality—today and in the future.  
 
  Although these principles focus on the rebuilding of a house, they apply equally well to the reengineering of computer-based systems and applications. 
 To implement these principles, you can use a software reengineering process 
model that deﬁ nes six activities, shown in Figure 36.2. In some cases, these ac-
tivities occur in a linear sequence, but this is not always the case. For example, it 
may be that reverse engineering (understanding the internal workings of a pro-
gram) may have to occur before document restructuring can commence.

Software Reengineering Activities 
 
The reengineering paradigm shown in Figure 36.2 is a cyclical model. This means that each of the activities presented as a part of the paradigm may be revis-
ited. For any particular cycle, the process can terminate after any one of these 
activities.   
Inventory analysis.   
Every software organization should have an inventory of all applications. The inventory can be nothing more than a spreadsheet model 
containing information that provides a detailed description (e.g., size, age, busi-
ness criticality) of every active application. By sorting this information according 
to business criticality, longevity, current maintainability and supportability, and 

other locally important criteria, candidates for reengineering appear. Resources 

can then be allocated to candidate applications for reengineering work.    If time and resources 
are in short supply, you 

might consider apply-
ing the Pareto principle 
to the software that 
is to be reengineered. 
Apply the reengineer-
ing process to the 
20 percent of the 
software that accounts 
for 80 percent of the 
problems. Forward
