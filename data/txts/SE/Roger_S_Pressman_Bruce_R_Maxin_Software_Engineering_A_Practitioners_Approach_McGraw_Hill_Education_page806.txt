Virtually every book written on software project management contains a discussion of 
scheduling. The Project Management Institute ( PMBOK Guide, 
 5th ed., PMI, 2013), Wysoki 
( Effective Project Management: Traditional, Agile, Extreme,
 
 6th ed., Wiley, 2011), Lewis ( 
Proj-
ect Planning Scheduling and Control,
 
 5th ed., McGraw-Hill, 2010), Kerzner ( 
Project Manage-
ment: A Systems Approach to Planning, Scheduling, and Controlling,
 
 10th ed., Wiley, 2009), 
Chemuturi and Cagley ( Mastering Software Project Management: Best Practices, Tools, and 
Techniques,
 
 J. Ross Publishing, 2010), Hughes and Cotterel ( 
Software Project Management,
 
 5th ed., McGraw-Hill, 2009), Luckey and Phillips ( Software Project Management for Dum-
mies, 
 For Dummies, 2006), Lewin ( 
Better Software Project Management,
 
 Wiley, 2001), and 
Bennatan ( On Time, Within Budget: Software Project Management Practices and Techniques,
 
 3rd ed., Wiley, 2000) contain worthwhile discussions of the subject. Although application 

speciﬁ c, Harris ( 
Planning and Scheduling Using Microsoft Ofﬁ
 ce Project 2010,
 
 Eastwood Har-
ris Pty Ltd., 2010) provides a useful discussion of how scheduling tools can be used to suc-
cessfully track and control a software project.  Fleming and Koppelman ( Earned Value Project Management,
 
 3rd ed., Project Manage-
ment Institute Publications, 2010), Budd ( A Practical Guide to Earned Value Project Man-
agement 
, 2nd ed., Management Concepts, 2009), and Webb and Wake ( 
Using Earned Value: 
A Project Manager’s Guide,
 
 Ashgate Publishing, 2003) discuss the use of earned value tech-
niques for project planning, tracking, and control in considerable detail.  A wide variety of information sources on software project scheduling is available on the Internet. An up-to-date list of World Wide Web references can be found under “software 

engineering resources” at the SEPA website:
