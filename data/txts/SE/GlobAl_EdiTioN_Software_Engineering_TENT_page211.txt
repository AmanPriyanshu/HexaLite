Subject05025ABCDFigure 7.11 Multiple displays four essential description elements and also include a brief statement of what the 
 pattern can do. This pattern can be used in situations where different presentations of an object™s state are required. It separates the object that must be displayed from the 
different forms of presentation. This is illustrated in Figure 7.11, which shows two 
different graphical presentations of the same dataset.Graphical representations are normally used to illustrate the object classes in 
 patterns and their relationships. These supplement the pattern description and add 
detail to the solution description. Figure 7.12 is the representation in UML of the 
Observer pattern.To use patterns in your design, you need to recognize that any design problem 
you are facing may have an associated pattern that can be applied. Examples of such 
problems, documented in the Gang of Four™s original patterns book, include:1. Tell several objects that the state of some other object has changed (Observer pattern).2. Tidy up the interfaces to a number of related objects that have often been devel-oped incrementally (Façade pattern).SubjectObserverAttach (Observer)Detach (Observer)Notify ()Update ()ConcreteSubjectGetState ()subjectStateConcreteObserverUpdate ()observerStateobserverState =
