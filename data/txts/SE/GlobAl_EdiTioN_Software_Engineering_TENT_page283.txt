PART As software systems are now part of all aspects of our lives, I believe that the most significant challenge that we face in software engineering is 

ensuring that we can trust these systems. To trust a system, we must have  confidence that it will be available when required and perform as expected. 
It must be secure so that our computers or data are not threatened by it and 
it has to recover quickly in the event of failure or cyberattack. This part of 
the book has therefore focuses on the important topics of software system 
dependability and security.Chapter 10 introduces the basic concepts of dependability and security 

namely reliability, availability, safety, security and resilience. I explain 

why building secure, dependable systems is not simply a technical 

problem. I introduce redundancy and diversity as the fundamental 

mechanisms used to create dependable and secure systems. The indi
-vidual dependability attributes are covered in more detail in the fol
-
lowing chapters.
Chapter 11 focuses on reliability and availability and I explain how these 
attributes can be specified as probabilities of failure or downtime. I dis
-
cuss a number of architectural patterns for fault-tolerant system architec
-
tures and development techniques that can be used to reduce the number 

of faults in a system. In the final section, I explain how the reliability of a 

system may be tested and measured.
