 Note The UML specifies one standard stereotype that applies to notes#requirements. This stereotype names a common category of notes#those used to state some responsibility or obligation.  Other Adornments The basic notation for an association, along with some of its adornments, are discussed in Chapters 5 and 10. Adornments are textual or graphical items that are added to an element's basic notation and are used to visualize details from the element's specification. For example, the basic notation for an association is a line, but this may be adorned with such details as the role and multiplicity of each end. In using the UML, the general rule to follow is this: Start with the basic notation for each element and then add other adornments only as they are necessary to convey specific information that is important to your model. Most adornments are rendered by placing text near the element of interest or by adding a graphic symbol to the basic notation. However, sometimes you'll want to adorn an element with more detail than can be accommodated by simple text or graphics. In the case of such things as classes, components, and nodes, you can add an extra compartment below the usual compartments to provide this information, as Figure 6-4 shows.
