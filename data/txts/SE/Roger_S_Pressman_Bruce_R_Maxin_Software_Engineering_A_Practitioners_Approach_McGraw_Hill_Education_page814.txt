You begin by listing all risks (no matter how remote) in the ﬁ
 rst column of 
the table. This can be accomplished with the help of the risk item checklists ref-
erenced in Section 35.3. Each risk is categorized in the second column (e.g., PS 
implies a project size risk, BU implies a business risk). The probability of occur-

rence of each risk is entered in the next column of the table. The probability 
value for each risk can be estimated by team members individually. One way to 

accomplish this is to poll individual team members in round-robin fashion until 
their collective assessment of risk probability begins to converge.  Next, the impact of each risk is assessed. Each risk component is assessed using the characterization presented in   
Figure 35.1  
, and an impact category is determined. The categories for each of the four risk components—performance, 
support, cost, and schedule—are averaged  3 
 
 to determine an overall impact value. 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
Once the ﬁ rst four columns of the risk table have been completed, the table 
is sorted by probability and by impact. High-probability, high-impact risks per-

colate to the top of the table, and low-probability risks drop to the bottom. This 
accomplishes ﬁ rst-order risk prioritization. 
 You can study the resultant sorted table and deﬁ
 ne a cutoff line. The  
cutoff line 
 (drawn horizontally at some point in the table) implies that only risks that 
lie above the line will be given further attention. Risks that fall below the line are    Think hard about 
the software you’re 
about to build and ask 
yourself, “what can go 
wrong?” Create your 
own list and ask other 
members of the team 
to do the same.    A risk table is sorted by 

probability and impact 
to rank risks. RisksSize estimate may be significantly lowLarger number of users than planned
