 Note The same class can play the same or different roles in other associations.  An instance of an association is called a link, as discussed in Chapter 15. Multiplicity   An association represents a structural relationship among objects. In many modeling situations, it's important for you to state how many objects may be connected across an instance of an association. This "how many" is called the multiplicity of an association's role, and is written as an expression that evaluates to a range of values or an explicit value as in Figure 5-6. When you state a multiplicity at one end of an association, you are specifying that, for each object of the class at the opposite end, there must be that many objects at the near end. You can show a multiplicity of exactly one (1), zero or one (0..1), many (0..*), or one or more (1..*). You can even state an exact number (for example, 3). Figure 5-6 Multiplicity  Note You can specify more complex multiplicities by using a list, such as 0..1, 3..4, 6..*, which would mean "any number of objects other than 2 or 5."
