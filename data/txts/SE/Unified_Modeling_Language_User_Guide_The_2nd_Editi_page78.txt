 The UML's defined constraints are discussed in Appendix B. Note Constraints may be written as free-form text. If you want to specify your semantics more precisely, you can use the UML's Object Constraint Language (OCL), described further in The The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual.  Constraints may be attached to more than one element by using dependencies, as discussed in Chapter 5. A constraint is rendered as a string enclosed by brackets and placed near the associated element. This notation is also used as an adornment to the basic notation of an element to visualize parts of an element's specification that have no graphical cue. For example, some properties of associations (order and changeability) are rendered using constraint notation. Standard Elements The UML's standard elements are summarized in Appendix B; classifiers are discussed in Chapter 9. The UML defines a number of standard stereotypes for classifiers, components, relationships, and other modeling elements. There is one standard stereotype, mainly of interest to tool builders, that lets you model stereotypes themselves. $ stereotype  Specifies that the classifier is a stereotype that may be applied to other elements You'll use this stereotype when you want to explicitly model the stereotypes you've defined for your project. The UML also specifies one standard tagged value that applies to all modeling elements.
