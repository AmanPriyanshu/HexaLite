 A review of these data indicates that one LOC of C11 provides approximately 
2.4 times the “functionality” (on average) as one LOC of C. Furthermore, one LOC 
of a Smalltalk provides at least four times the functionality of an LOC for a con-
ventional programming language such as Ada, COBOL, or C. Using the informa-
tion contained in the table, it is possible to “backﬁ re” [Jon98] existing software to 
estimate the number of function points, once the total number of programming 
language statements are known.  LOC and FP measures are often used to derive productivity metrics.
 This 
 invariably leads to a debate about the use of such data. Should the LOC/ person-month (or FP/person-month) of one group be compared to similar 
data from another? Should managers appraise the performance of individuals 
by using these metrics? The answer to these questions is an emphatic no! The 
reason for this response is that many factors inﬂ uence productivity, making for 
“ apples and oranges” comparisons that can be easily misinterpreted.  Function points and LOC-based metrics have been found to be relatively ac-
curate predictors of software development effort and cost. However, in order to 

use LOC and FP for estimation (Chapter 33), an historical baseline of information 
must be established.  Within the context of process and project metrics, you should be concerned 
primarily with productivity and quality—measures of software development 
“output” as a function of effort and time applied and measures of the “ﬁ tness 
for use” of the work products that are produced. For process improvement and 
project planning purposes, your interest is historical. What was software devel-
opment productivity on past projects? What was the quality of the software that pre22126_ch32_703-726.indd   712pre22126_ch32_703-726.indd   71213/12/13   6:17 PM13/12/13   6:17 PM
