391 MOBILEAPP DESIGN   
 
 
 Mobile devices—smartphones, tablets, wearable devices, and other specialized products—have become the next wave of computing. 
The Los Angeles Times
 
 [Rod12] reported: 
 
For the ﬁ rst time ever more Americans own smartphones than regular phones or 
feature phones, a new report says.  The report, put out by Chetan Sharma Consulting  1 
 
, shows smartphone penetra-tion has crossed the 50% mark for the ﬁ rst time in the U.S.

QUICK LOOK   
What is it?   MobileApp design encompasses technical and non-
technical activities that include: 
establishing the look and feel of the mobile application, creating the aesthetic 
layout of the user interface, establishing the 

rhythm of user interaction, deﬁ ning the overall 
architectural structure, developing the content 
and functionality that reside within the architec-
ture, and planning the navigation that occurs 
within the MobileApp. Special attention needs 
to be given to the elements that add context 
awareness to the MobileApp.   
 
Who does it?   Software engineers, graphic  designers, content developers, security spe-cialists, and other stakeholders all participate 

in the creation of a MobileApp design model.   
 
Why is it important? 
  Design allows you to 
create a model that can be assessed for quality 

and improved before content and code are gen-
erated, tests are conducted, and end users be-
come involved in large numbers. Design is the 

place where MobileApp quality is established. 
  
 
What are the steps?   MobileApp design is sim-ilar to WebApp design and encompasses six 

major steps that are driven by information ob-

tained during requirements modeling. Content 
design addresses the same issues for both 
 WebApp and MobileApp design. During archi-
tectural design, MobileApp developers deter-

mine which functions will be implemented in the 

native app running on the mobile device and 

which will be implemented as Web or cloud 

services. Interface design establishes the lay-

out and interaction mechanisms that deﬁ ne the 
user experience. Ensuring that the MobileApp 

makes appropriate use of context affects both 

interface design and content design. Naviga-

tion design deﬁ nes how the end user navigates 
through the content structure, and component 

design represents the detailed internal structure 

of functional elements of the MobileApp. 
  
 
What is the work product? 
  A design model 
that encompasses content, aesthetics, architec-
ture, interface, navigation, and component-level 

design issues is the primary work product that 

is produced during MobileApp design. 
  
 
How do I ensure that I’ve done it right?   Each element of the design model is reviewed in an effort to uncover errors, incon-

sistencies, or omissions. In addition, alterna-

tive solutions are considered, and the degree 
to which the current design model will lead to 
an effective implementation is also assessed.
