  Chapter 9. Advanced Classes In this chapter · Classifiers, special properties of attributes and operations, and different kinds of classes · Modeling the semantics of a class · Choosing the right kind of classifier Classes are indeed the most important building block of any object-oriented system. However, classes are just one kind of an even more general building block in the UML#classifiers. A classifier is a mechanism that describes structural and behavioral features. Classifiers include classes, interfaces, datatypes, signals, components, nodes, use cases, and subsystems. The basic properties of classes are discussed in Chapter 4. Classifiers (and especially classes) have a number of advanced features beyond the simpler properties of attributes and operations described in the previous section: You can model multiplicity, visibility, signatures, polymorphism, and other characteristics. In the UML, you can model the semantics of a class so that you can state its meaning to whatever degree of formality you like. In the UML, there are several kinds of classifiers and classes; it's important that you choose the one that best models your abstraction of the real world. Getting Started Architecture is discussed in Chapter 2.
