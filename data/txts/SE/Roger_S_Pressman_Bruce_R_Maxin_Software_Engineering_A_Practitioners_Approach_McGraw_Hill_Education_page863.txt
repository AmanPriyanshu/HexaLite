SPICE.   The SPICE ( Software Process Improvement and Capability dEtermination
 
) model [SPI99] provides an SPI assessment framework that is compliant with ISO 

15504:2003 and ISO 12207. The SPICE document suite [SDS08] presents a complete 

SPI framework including a model for process management, guidelines for con-
ducting an assessment and rating the process under consideration, construction, 

selection, and use of assessment instruments and tools, and training for assessors. 
  
 
Bootstrap.   
The  Bootstrap 
 SPI framework “has been developed to ensure con-
formance with the emerging ISO standard for software process assessment and 
improvement (SPICE) and to align the methodology with ISO 12207” [Boo06]. The 
objective of Bootstrap is to evaluate a software process using a set of software 
engineering best practices as a basis for assessment. Like the CMMI, Bootstrap 
provides a process maturity level using the results of questionnaires that gather 
information about the “as is” software process and software projects. SPI guide-
lines are based on maturity level and organizational goals.
