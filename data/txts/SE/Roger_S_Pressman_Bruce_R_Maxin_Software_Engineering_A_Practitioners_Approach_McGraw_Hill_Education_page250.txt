MODELINGcomplexities (e.g., distributing load among multiple servers, caching architec-tures, remote databases, multiple servers serving various objects) may have an 

impact on analysis and design. The UML  deployment diagram 
 can be used in situ-
ations in which complex conﬁ guration architectures must be considered.

 the public content and functionality should 
be speciﬁ ed to be accessible across all major Web clients (i.e., those with more 
than 1 percent market share or greater). Conversely, it may be acceptable to 

restrict the more complex control and monitoring functionality (which is only 
accessible to  HomeOwner 
 
 
 users) to a smaller set of clients. For a mobile app, 
implementation might be limited to the three leading mobile operating environ-
ments. The conﬁ guration model for

 will also specify 
interoperability with existing product databases and monitoring applications.   
 
11.5.8  Navigation Modeling 
 
In most mobile applications that reside on smartphone platforms, navigation is generally constrained to relatively simple button lists and icon-based menus. In 
addition, the depth of navigation (i.e., the number of levels into the hypermedia 
hierarchy) is relatively shallow. For these reasons, navigation modeling is rela-

tively simple.  For WebApps and an increasing number of tablet-based mobile applications, nav-
igation modeling is more complex and often considers how each user category will 

navigate from one WebApp element (e.g., content object) to another. The mechanics
