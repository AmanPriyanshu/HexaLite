Determine a basis set of linearly independent paths. 
 The value of  V 
( G 
) provides the number of linearly independent paths through the program 
control structure. In the case of procedure  average, 
 we expect to specify six paths:  
 
 
 
 
 
Path 1: 1-2-10-11-13 
   
 
 
 
 
Path 2: 1-2-10-12-13 
   
 
 
 
 
Path 3: 1-2-3-10-11-13 
   
 
 
 
 
Path 4: 
   
 
 
 
 
Path 5: 
   
 
 
 
 
Path 6: 
 
 
  
 
   
the remainder of the control structure is acceptable. It is often worthwhile 
to identify predicate nodes as an aid in the derivation of test cases. In this 
case, nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, and 10 are predicate nodes.

Prepare test cases that will force execution of each path in the basis set. 
 Data should be chosen so that conditions at the predicate nodes are 
appropriately set as each path is tested. Each test case is executed and 
compared to expected results. Once all test cases have been completed, 
the tester can be sure that all statements in the program have been exe-
cuted at least once.  
 
  It is important to note that some independent paths (e.g., path 1 in our ex-ample) cannot be tested in stand-alone fashion. That is, the combination of data 
required to traverse the path cannot be achieved in the normal ﬂ ow of the pro-
gram. In such cases, these paths are tested as part of another path test.

Graph Matrices  
The procedure for deriving the ﬂ ow graph and even determining a set of basis 
paths is amenable to mechanization. A data structure, called a  graph matrix, 
 can 
be quite useful for developing a software tool that assists in basis path testing.  A graph matrix is a square matrix whose size (i.e., number of rows and col-umns) is equal to the number of nodes on the ﬂ ow graph. Each row and column 
corresponds to an identiﬁ ed node, and matrix entries correspond to connections 
(an edge) between nodes. A simple example of a ﬂ ow graph and its correspond-
ing graph matrix [Bei90] is shown in  Figure 23.6 .   Referring to the ﬁ gure, each node on the ﬂ
 ow graph is identiﬁ
 ed by numbers, 
while each edge is identiﬁ ed by letters. A letter entry is made in the matrix to 
correspond to a connection between two nodes. For example, node 3 is connected 
to node 4 by edge  b 
.   
 
To this point, the graph matrix is nothing more than a tabular representation 
of a ﬂ ow graph. However, by adding a  
link weight 
 to each matrix entry, the graph
