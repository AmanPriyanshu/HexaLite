QUALITY MANAGEMENTapproach partitions tests based on the interfaces to a particular class. Refer-
ring to  Figure 24.2 , the  Bank 
 class receives messages from the  
ATM
 
 and  
Cashier 
 classes. The methods within  Bank 
 can therefore be tested by partitioning them 
into those that serve  ATM
 
 and those that serve  
Cashier.
 
 State-based partitioning 
(Section 24.5.2) can be used to reﬁ ne the partitions further. 
 
 
 
 
24.6.2   
Tests Derived from Behavior Models 
 
The use of the state diagram as a model that represents the dynamic behavior of a class is discussed in Chapter 11. The state diagram for a class can be used 
to help derive a sequence of tests that will exercise the dynamic behavior of the 
class (and those classes that collaborate with it).  Figure 24.3  [Kir94] illustrates a 
state diagram for the  Account 
 class discussed earlier. Referring to the ﬁ
 gure, ini-
tial transitions move through the  empty acct 
 and  
setup acct 
 states. The majority 
of all behavior for instances of the class occurs while in the  working acct 
 state. A 
ﬁ nal withdrawal and account closure cause the account class to make transitions 
to the  nonworking acct 
 and  dead acct 
 states, respectively. 
  The tests to be designed should achieve coverage of every state. That is, the operation sequences should cause the  Account 
 class to make transition through 
all allowable states:

It should be noted that this sequence is identical to the minimum test sequence discussed in Section 24.5.2. Adding additional test sequences to the 
minimum sequence,
