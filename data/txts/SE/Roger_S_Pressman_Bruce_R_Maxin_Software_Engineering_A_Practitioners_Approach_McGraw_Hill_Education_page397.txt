Sign-up Flows.
 
 How do I provide a simple way to sign in or register for 
information or functionality? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Custom Tab Navigation.
 
 How do I represent a variety of different content 
objects in a manner that enables the user to select the one she wants? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Invitations.
 
 How do I inform the user that he must participate in some 
action or dialog? Typical examples are illustrated in  
Figure 16.3

Additional information about mobile UI patterns can be found in [Nei12] and 
[Hoo12]. In addition to UI patterns, Meier and his colleagues [Mei12] propose a 
variety of more general pattern descriptions for mobile apps. Further informa-
tion on mobile patterns, including an extensive pattern library

 has been devel-
oped by Nokia [Nok13].

Design patterns provide a codiÔ¨Å
 ed mechanism for describing problems and their 
solution in a way that allows the software engineering community to capture de-
sign knowledge for reuse. A pattern describes a problem, indicates the context 
enabling the user to understand the environment in which the problem resides, 
and lists a system of forces that indicate how the problem can be interpreted
