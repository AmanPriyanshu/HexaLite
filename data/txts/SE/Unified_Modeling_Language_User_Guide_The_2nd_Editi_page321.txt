Figure 28-3 Frameworks  Note Frameworks can be distinguished from plain class libraries. A class library contains abstractions that your abstractions instantiate or invoke; a framework contains abstractions that may instantiate or invoke your abstractions. Both of these kinds of connections constitute the framework's slots, tabs, knobs, and dials that you must adjust in order to adapt the framework to your context. Common Modeling Techniques Modeling Design Patterns One thing for which you'll use patterns is to model a design pattern. When you model a mechanism such as this, you have to take into account its inside, as well as its outside, view. When viewed from the outside, a design pattern is rendered as a parameterized collaboration. As a collaboration, a pattern provides a set of abstractions whose structure and behavior work together to carry out some useful function. The collaboration's parameters name the elements that a user of this pattern must bind. This makes the design pattern a template that you use in a particular context by supplying elements that match the template parameters. When viewed from the inside, a design pattern is simply a collaboration and is rendered with its structural and behavioral parts. Typically, you'll model the inside of this collaboration with a set of class diagrams (for the structural aspect) and a set of interactions (for the behavioral aspect). The collaboration's parameters name certain of these structural elements, which, when the design pattern is bound in a particular context, are instantiated using abstractions from that context. To model a design pattern, Using collaborations to model a mechanism is discussed in Chapter 27. Â· Identify the common solution to the common problem and reify it as a mechanism.
