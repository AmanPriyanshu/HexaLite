  P
ROBLEMS AND POINTS TO PONDER  
 
 
 
5.1.  Reread the “Manifesto for Agile Software Development” at the beginning of this chap-ter. Can you think of a situation in which one or more of the four “values” could get a soft-

ware team into trouble?    
 
5.2.  Describe agility (for software projects) in your own words.    
 
5.3.  Why does an iterative process make it easier to manage change? Is every agile process discussed in this chapter iterative? Is it possible to complete a project in just one iteration 
and still be agile? Explain your answers.    
 
5.4.  Could each of the agile processes be described using the generic framework activities noted in Chapter 3? Build a table that maps the generic activities into the activities deﬁ ned 
for each agile process.    
 
5.5.  Try to come up with one more “agility principle” that would help a software engineering 
team become even more maneuverable.    
 
5.6.  Select one agility principle noted in Section 5.3.1 and try to determine whether each of the process models presented in this chapter exhibits the principle. [Note: We have pre-

sented an overview of these process models only, so it may not be possible to determine 

whether a principle has been addressed by one or more of the models, unless you do addi-
tional research (which is not required for this problem).]    
 
5.7.  Why do requirements change so much? After all, don’t people know what they want?    
 
5.8.  Most agile process models recommend face-to-face communication. Yet today, mem-
bers of a software team and their customers may be geographically separated from one 
another. Do you think this implies that geographical separation is something to avoid? Can 

you think of ways to overcome this problem?    
 
5.9.  Write an XP user story that describes the “favorite places” or “favorites” feature avail-
able on most Web browsers. 
   
 
5.10.  What is a spike solution in XP?    
 
5.11.  Describe the XP concepts of refactoring and pair programming in your own words.    
 
5.12.  Using the process pattern template presented in Chapter 3, develop a process pattern for any one of the Scrum patterns presented in Section 5.5.1.    
 
5.13.  Visit the Ofﬁ
 cial Agile Modeling site and make a complete list of all core and supple-
mentary AM principles.    
 
5.14.  The tool set proposed in Section 5.6 supports many of the “soft” aspects of agile meth-ods. Since communication is so important, recommend an actual tool set that might be used 
to enhance communication among stakeholders on an agile team.
