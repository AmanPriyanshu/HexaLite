˜a system means that you have to find the closest match between the system require-ments and the facilities offered by off-the-shelf systems. ERP and other large-scale 

application systems usually fall into this category. You may then have to modify the 

requirements to fit in with the system assumptions. This can have knock-on effects 

on other subsystems. You also usually have an extensive configuration process to 

tailor and adapt the application or ERP system to the buyer™s working environment.3. When a system is to be built specially, the specification of requirements is part 

of the contract for the system being acquired. It is therefore a legal as well as a 
technical document. The requirements document is critical, and procurement 

processes of this type usually take a considerable amount of time.4. For public sector systems in particular, there are detailed rules and regulations 

that affect the procurement of systems. For example, in the European Union, all 

public sector systems over a certain price must be open to tender by any supplier 
in Europe. This requires detailed tender documents to be drawn up and the ten-
der to be advertised across Europe for a fixed period of time. Not only does this 
rule slow down the procurement process, it also tends to inhibit agile develop-
ment. It forces the system buyer to develop requirements so that all companies 
have enough information to bid for the system contract.5. For application systems that require change or for custom systems, there is usu-
ally a contract negotiation period when the customer and supplier negotiate the 
terms and conditions for development of the system. Once a system has been
