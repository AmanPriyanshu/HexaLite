CHAPTER 20  
REVIEW TECHNIQUES 437 
Requirements-related errors uncovered during testing require an average of 45 person-hours to ﬁ nd and correct (no data are available on the relative severity 
of the error). Using the averages noted, we get:Effort saved per error 5 Etesting 2 Ereviews 45 
2 6 5 30 person-hours/error  Since 22 errors were found during the review of the requirements model, a sav-ing of about 660 person-hours of testing effort would be achieved. And that’s just 

for requirements-related errors. Errors associated with design and code would 
add to the overall beneﬁ t. The bottom line—effort saved leads to shorter delivery 
cycles and improved time to market.  In his book on peer reviews, Karl Wiegers [Wie02] discusses anecdotal data 
from major companies that have used  inspections 
 (a relatively formal type of tech-
nical review) as part of their software quality control activities. Hewlett-Packard 
(HP) reported a 10 to 1 return on investment for inspections and noted that ac-
tual product delivery accelerated by an average of 1.8 calendar months. AT&T 

indicated that inspections reduced the overall cost of software errors by a fac-
tor of 10 and that quality improved by an order of magnitude and productivity 
increased by 14 percent. Others report similar beneﬁ ts. Technical reviews (for 
design and other technical activities) provide a demonstrable cost beneﬁ t and 
actually save time.  But for many software people, this statement is counterintuitive. “Reviews take time,” software people argue, “and we don’t have the time to spare!” They 
argue that time is a precious commodity on every software project and the ability 
to review “every work product in detail” absorbs too much time.  The examples presented previously in this section indicate otherwise. More im-portantly, industry data for software reviews has been collected for more than two 

decades and is summarized qualitatively using the graphs illustrated in  Figure 20.4 . PlanningRequirementsWithout
