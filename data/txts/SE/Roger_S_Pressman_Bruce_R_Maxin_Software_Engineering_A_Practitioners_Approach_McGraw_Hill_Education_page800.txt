MANAGING SOFTWARE PROJECTS
 
Let’s consider the  
 
SafeHomeAssured.com 
 
 to better understand macroscopic 
scheduling. Recalling previous discussions of  
 
SafeHomeAssured.com 
 
, seven in-crements can be identiﬁ ed for the Web-based component of the project:
  
 
 
 
 
 
Increment 1: Basic company and product information    
 
 
 
 
Increment 2: Detailed product information and downloads    
 
 
 
 
Increment 3: Product quotes and processing product orders    
 
 
 
 
Increment 4: Space layout and security system design    
 
 
 
 
Increment 5: Information and ordering of monitoring services    
 
 
 
 
Increment 6: Online control of monitoring equipment    
 
 
 
 
Increment 7: Accessing account information  
 
  The team consults and negotiates with stakeholders and develops a  prelim-
inary 
 deployment schedule for all seven increments. A time-line chart for this 
schedule is illustrated in   
Figure 34.5  
.  
 
 
 
  It is important to note that the deployment dates (represented by diamonds on 
the time-line chart) are preliminary and may change as more detailed scheduling 

of the increments occurs. However, this macroscopic schedule provides manage-

ment with an indication of when content and functionality will be available and 

when the entire project will be completed. As a preliminary estimate, the team 

will work to deploy all increments with a 12-week time line. It’s also worth noting 

that some of the increments will be developed in parallel (e.g., increments 3, 4, and 

7). This assumes that the team will have sufﬁ cient people to do this parallel work.
