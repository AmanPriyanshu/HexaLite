QUALITY MANAGEMENT 
When orthogonal array testing occurs, an L9  orthogonal array 
 of test cases is 
created. The L9 orthogonal array has a “balancing property” [Pha97]. That is, test 
cases (represented by dark dots in the ﬁ gure) are “dispersed uniformly through-
out the test domain,” as illustrated in the right-hand cube in  Figure 23.9 . Test 
coverage across the input domain is more complete.  To illustrate the use of the L9 orthogonal array, consider the  
send 
 function for 
a fax application. Four parameters, P1, P2, P3, and P4, are passed to the  send 
 function. Each takes on three discrete values. For example, P1 takes on values:  
 
 
 
 
 
P1 5 1, send it now    
 
 
 
 
P1 5 2, send it one hour later    
 
 
 
 
P1 5 3, send it after midnight    
 
 
 
 
P2, P3, and P4 would also take on values of 1, 2 and 3, signifying other send functions.  
 
  If a “one input item at a time” testing strategy were chosen, the following se-quence of tests (P1, P2, P3, P4) would be speciﬁ ed: (1, 1, 1, 1), (2, 1, 1, 1), (3, 1, 1, 1), 
(1, 2, 1, 1), (1, 3, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2, 1), (1, 1, 3, 1), (1, 1, 1, 2), and (1, 1, 1, 3). But these would 
uncover only  single mode faults 
 [Pha97], that is, faults that are triggered by a 
single parameter. 
 Given the relatively small number of input parameters and discrete values, exhaustive testing is possible. The number of tests required is 3 4  5 81, large but 
manageable. All faults associated with data item permutation would be found, 
but the effort required is relatively high.  The orthogonal array testing approach enables you to provide good test cover-
age with far fewer test cases than the exhaustive strategy. An L9 orthogonal array 

for the fax  send 
 function is illustrated in  Figure 23.10 . Test
