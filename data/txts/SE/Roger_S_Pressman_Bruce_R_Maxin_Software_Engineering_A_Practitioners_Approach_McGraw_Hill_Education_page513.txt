  Performance tests are conducted.

  The WebApp is tested by a controlled and monitored population of end 
users. The results of their interaction with the system are evaluated for 
errors.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
Because many WebApps evolve continuously, the testing process is an ongo-
ing activity, conducted by support staff who use regression tests derived from the 

tests developed when the WebApp was ﬁ
 rst engineered. Methods for WebApp 
testing are considered in Chapter 25.

TEST STRATEGIES
 FOR MOBILEAPPS  
 
The strategy for testing mobile applications adopts the basic principles for all software testing. However, the unique nature of MobileApps demands the con-

sideration of a number of specialized testing approaches:  
 
 
•   
User-experience testing.
 
 Users are involved early in the development pro-cess to ensure that the MobileApp lives up to the usability and accessibil-
ity expectations of the stakeholders on all supported devices.   
 
 
•   
Device compatibility testing 
. Testers verify that the MobileApp works cor-
rectly on all required hardware and software combinations.   
 
 
•   
Performance testing. 
 Testers check nonfunctional requirements unique to 
mobile devices (e.g., download times, processor speed, storage capacity, 

power availability).   
 
 
•   
Connectivity testing. 
 Testers ensure that the MobileApp can access any 
needed networks or Web services and can tolerate weak or interrupted 

network access.   
 
 
•   
Security testing 
. Testers ensure that the MobileApp does not compromise 
the privacy or security requirements of its users.   
 
 
•   
Testing-in-the-wild
 
. The app is tested under realistic conditions on actual user devices in a variety of networking environments around the globe.   
 
 
•  Certiﬁ cation testing. Testers ensure that the MobileApp meets the stan-
dards established by the app stores that will distribute it.  
 
  Methods for MobileApp testing are considered in Chapter 26.

VALIDATION
 TESTING  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Validation testing begins at the culmination of integration testing, when individ-
ual components have been exercised, the software is completely assembled as 
a package, and interfacing errors have been uncovered and corrected. At the pre22126_ch22_466-495.indd   483pre22126_ch22_466-495.indd   48313/12/13   6:14 PM13/12/13   6:14 PM
