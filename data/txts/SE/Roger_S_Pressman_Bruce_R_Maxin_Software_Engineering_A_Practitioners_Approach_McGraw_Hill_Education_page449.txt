QUALITY CONCEPTS 419 
To conduct your assessment, you’ll need to address speciﬁ
 c, measurable (or at 
least, recognizable) attributes of the interface. For example [Bro03]:   
Intuitiveness.   The degree to which the interface follows expected usage  
patterns 
so that even a novice can use it without signiﬁ cant training.
 
 
 
 
•  Is the interface layout conducive to easy understanding?   
 
 
•  Are interface operations easy to locate and initiate?   
 
 
•  Does the interface use a recognizable metaphor?   
 
 
•  Is input speciﬁ ed to economize key strokes or mouse clicks? 
  
 
 
•  Does the interface follow the three golden rules? (Chapter 15)   
 
 
•  Do aesthetics aid in understanding and usage?  
 
  
 
 
Efficiency.   The degree to which operations and information can be located or initiated.  
 
 
•  Does the interface layout and style allow a user to locate operations and information efﬁ ciently? 
  
 
 
•  Can a sequence of operations (or data input) be performed with an econ-omy of motion?   
 
 
•  Are output data or content presented so that it is understood immediately? 
  
 
 
•  Have hierarchical operations been organized in a way that minimizes the depth to which a user must navigate to get something done?  
 
  
 
 
Robustness.   The degree to which the software handles bad input data or inap-propriate user interaction.  
 
 
•  Will the software recognize the error if data values are at or just outside 
prescribed input boundaries? More importantly, will the software con-

tinue to operate without failure or degradation?   
 
 
•  Will the interface recognize common cognitive or manipulative mistakes 
and explicitly guide the user back on the right track?   
 
 
•  Does the interface provide useful diagnosis and guidance when an error condition (associated with software functionality) is uncovered?  
 
  
 
 
Richness.   The degree to which the interface provides a rich feature set. 
 
 
 
•  Can the interface be customized to the speciﬁ c needs of a user? 
  
 
 
•  Does the interface provide a macro capability that enables a user to iden-tify a sequence of common operations with a single action or command?   
 
As the interface design is developed, the software team would review 
the design prototype and ask the questions noted. If the answer to most of 

these questions is yes, it is likely that the user interface exhibits high quality.
