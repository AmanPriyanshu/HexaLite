 A resource manager, which allocates appropriate memory and processor 

resources to processes that have been scheduled for execution.5. A dispatcher, which is responsible for starting the execution of processes.Real-time operating systems for large systems, such as process control or telecom-munication systems, may have additional facilities, namely, disk storage management, 

fault management facilities that detect and report system faults, and a configuration 

manager that supports the dynamic reconfiguration of real-time applications.Real-time systems have to handle external events quickly and, in some cases, meet 
deadlines for processing these events. The event-handling processes must therefore 
be scheduled for execution in time to detect the event. They must also be allocated 
sufficient processor resources to meet their deadline. The process manager in an 

RTOS is responsible for choosing processes for execution, allocating processor and 
memory resources, and starting and stopping process execution on a processor.Process resource
