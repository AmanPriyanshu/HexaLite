FORMAL MODELING AND VERIFICATION
 605the data encapsulated in the state box that must be retained between the transitions implied.   
Clear box. 
 The transition functions that are implied by the state box are deﬁ ned in the clear box. Stated simply, a clear box contains the proce-
dural design for the state box.   
Figure 28.2  illustrates the reﬁ nement approach using box structure speciﬁ
 ca-
tion. A black box (BB1) deﬁ nes responses for a complete set of stimuli. BB
1 can be 
reﬁ ned into a set of black boxes, BB
1.1 to BB
1. n , each of which addresses a class of behavior. Reﬁ
 nement continues until a cohesive class of behavior is identiﬁ
 ed 
(e.g., BB1.1.1). A state box (SB1.1.1) is then deﬁ ned for the black box (BB
1.1.1). In this case, SB1.1.1 contains all data and services required to implement the behavior 
deﬁ ned by BB
1.1.1. Finally, SB
1.1.1 is reﬁ
 ned into clear boxes (CB
1.1.1. n ) and procedural design details are speciﬁ ed. 
 
 
 
 
  As each of these reﬁ nement steps occurs, veriﬁ
 cation of correctness also oc-
curs. State-box speciﬁ cations are veriﬁ
 ed to ensure that each conforms to the 
behavior deﬁ ned by the parent black-box speciﬁ
 cation. Similarly, clear-box spec-
iﬁ cations are veriﬁ
 ed against the parent state box. 
 
 
 
28.2.1   
Black-Box Speciﬁ cation 
 
 
A  black-box 
 speciﬁ
 cation describes an abstraction, stimuli, and response using 
the notation shown in  Figure 28.3  [Mil88]. The function  
f 
 is applied to a sequence 
 S* 
 of inputs (stimuli)  
S 
 and transforms them into an output (response)  
R. 
 For sim-
ple software components,  f 
 may be a mathematical function, but in general,  
f 
 is 
described using natural language (or a formal speciﬁ cation language).

to every problem 

is simple. It’s the 

distance between 
the two where the 
mystery lies.”
