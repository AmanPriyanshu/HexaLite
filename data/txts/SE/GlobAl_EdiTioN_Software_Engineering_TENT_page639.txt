PART It is sometimes suggested that the key difference between software engi-neering and other types of programming is that software engineering is 
a managed process. By this, I mean that the software development takes 

place within an organization and is subject to a range of schedule, budget 
and organizational constraints. I introduce a range of management topics in 
this part of the book with a focus on technical management issues rather 
than ‚softer™ management issues such as people management, or the more 
strategic management of enterprise systems.Chapters 22 and 23 focus on the essential project management activities, 

planning, risk management and people management. Chapter 22 intro
-
duces software project management and its first major section is con
-
cerned with risk management where managers identify what might go 

wrong and plan what they might do about it. This chapter also includes 

sections on people management and team working.
Chapter 23 covers project planning and estimation. I introduce bar charts 
as fundamental planning tools and explain why plan-driven development 

will remain an important development approach, in spite of the success 

of agile methods. I also discuss issues that influence the price charged 

for a system and techniques of software cost estimation. I use the 

COCOMO family of cost models to describe algorithmic cost modeling 

and explain the benefits and disadvantages of algorithmic approaches.4 ˜˚˛˝˙ˆˇ˘
