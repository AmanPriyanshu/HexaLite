CHAPTER 18  
MOBILEAPP DESIGN 409 
Component design develops the detailed processing logic required to imple-ment the components that are used to build a complete MobileApp function. De-
sign techniques described in Chapter 14 may be applicable for the engineering 
of MobileApp components.

ROBLEMS AND POINTS TO PONDER  
 
 
 
18.1  Explain why deciding to develop MobileApp for several devices can be a costly design decision. Is there a way to mitigate the risks of supporting the wrong platform?    
 
18.2  In this chapter we listed many quality attributes for MobileApps. Select the three that you believe are most important, and make an argument that explains why each should be 
emphasized in MobileApp design work.    
 
18.3  Add at least ﬁ ve additional questions to the MobileApp Design—Quality Checklist pre-
sented in Section 18.2.    
 
18.4  You are a MobileApp designer for  
Project Planning
 
  Corporation 
, a company that builds productivity software. You want to implement the equivalent of a digital three-ring binder 

that allows tablet users to organize and categorize electronic documents of several types 
under user-deﬁ
 ned tabs. For example, a kitchen remodeling project might require a pdf 
catalog, a jpg or dfx layout drawing, an MS Word proposal, and an Excel spreadsheet stored 

under a Cabinetry tab. Once deﬁ ned, the binder and its tab content can be stored either 
on the tablet or on some cloud storage. The application needs to provide ﬁ ve key func-
tions: binder and tab deﬁ nition, digital document acquisition from a Web location or the 
device, binder management functions, page display functions, and a notes function to allow 
a Post-it note to be added to any page. Develop an interface design for the three-ring appli-
cation and implement it as a paper prototype.    
 
18.5  What is the most aesthetically pleasing MobileApp you have ever used and why?    
 
18.6  Create user stories for the three-ring application described in Problem 18.4.    
 
18.7  What might be considered to make the three-ring application a context-aware MobileApp?    
 
18.8  Reconsidering the  ProjectPlanning
 
 three-ring application described in Problem 18.4, 
select a development platform for the ﬁ rst working prototype. Discuss why you made the 
choice.    
 
18.9  Use UML to develop design representations for the interface objects that would be  encountered as the three-ring application described in Problem 18.4 is designed.    
 
18.10  Do a bit of additional research on the MVC architecture and decide whether it would be an appropriate MobileApp architecture for the three-ring discussed in Problem 18.4.    
 
18.11  Describe three context-aware features that would be desirable to add to a  SafeHome 
 MobileApp.    
 
18.12  Do some Internet research to identify a middleware product designed to support  MobileApps. Describe the middleware features and the platform(s) it supports.
