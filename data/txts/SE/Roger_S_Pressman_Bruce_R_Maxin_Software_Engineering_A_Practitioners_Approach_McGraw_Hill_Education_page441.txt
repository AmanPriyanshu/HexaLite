411 In this part of  Software Engineering: A Practitioner’s Approach
 
 you’ll learn about the principles, concepts, and techniques 
that are applied to manage and control software quality. 
These questions are addressed in the chapters that follow:  
 
 •  What are the generic characteristics of high-quality software?    
 •  How do we review quality and how are effective reviews conducted?    
 •  What is software quality assurance?    
 •  What strategies are applicable for software testing?    
 •  What methods are used to design effective test cases?    
 •  Are there realistic methods that will ensure that software is correct?    
 •  How can we manage and control changes that always occur as software is built?    
 •  What measures and metrics can be used to assess the qual-ity of requirements and design models, source code, and 
test cases?
