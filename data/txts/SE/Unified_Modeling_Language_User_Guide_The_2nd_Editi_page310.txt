 Behavior Interaction diagrams are discussed in Chapter 18; instances are discussed in Chapter 13. Whereas the structural part of a collaboration is typically rendered using a class diagram, the behavioral part of a collaboration is typically rendered using an interaction diagram. An interaction diagram specifies an interaction that represents a behavior comprised of a set of messages that are exchanged among a set of objects within a context to accomplish a specific purpose. An interaction's context is provided by its enclosing collaboration, which establishes the classes, interfaces, components, nodes, and other structural elements whose instances may participate in that interaction. The behavioral part of a collaboration may be specified by one or more interaction diagrams. If you want to emphasize the time ordering of messages, use a sequence diagram. If you want to emphasize the structural relationships among these objects as they collaborate, use a collaboration diagram. Either diagram is appropriate because, for most purposes, they are semantically equivalent. This means that when you model a society of classes by naming their interaction as a collaboration, you can zoom inside that collaboration to expose the details of their behavior. For example, zooming inside the collaboration named Internode messaging might reveal the interaction diagram shown in Figure 27-3. Figure 27-3 Behavioral Aspects of a Collaboration
