. In fact, the PNR curve indicates the project delivery time cannot be compressed much beyond 0.75 t 
 d 
. If we at-tempt further compression, the project moves into “the impossible region” and 
risk of failure becomes very high. The PNR curve also indicates that the lowest

. The implication here is that delaying project deliv-ery can reduce costs signiﬁ cantly. Of course, this must be weighed against the 
business cost associated with the delay. 
 The software equation [Put92] introduced in Chapter 33 is derived from the PNR curve and demonstrates the highly nonlinear relationship between chrono-
logical time to complete a project and human effort applied to the project. The 
number of delivered lines of code (source statements),  L, 
 is related to effort and 
development time by the equation:

t

  where  E 
 is development effort in person-months,  
P 
 is a productivity parameter 
that reﬂ ects a variety of factors that leads to high-quality software engineering 
work (typical values for  P 
 range between 2000 and 12,000), and  
t 
 is the project 
duration in calendar months.  Rearranging this software equation, we can arrive at an expression for devel-opment effort E: E 
 5   L3 ____ P3t4   (34.1) 
 where  E 
 is the effort expended (in person-years) over the entire life cycle for 
software development and maintenance and  t 
 is the development time in years. 
The equation for development effort can be related to development cost by the 
inclusion of a burdened labor rate factor ($/person-year).  This leads to some interesting results. Consider a complex, real-time software project estimated at 33,000 LOC, 12 person-years of effort. If eight people are 
assigned to the project team, the project can be completed in approximately 
1.3 years. If, however, we extend the end date to 1.75 years, the highly nonlinear 

nature of the model described in Equation (34.1) yields: E 
 5   L3 ____ P3t4   ~ 3.8 person-years  This implies that, by extending the end date by six months, we can reduce the number of people from eight to four! The validity of such results is open to de-
bate, but the implication is clear: beneﬁ t can be gained by using fewer people 
over a somewhat longer time span to accomplish the same objective.

Each of the software project estimation techniques discussed in Chapter 33 leads to estimates of work units (e.g., person-months) required to complete software    If delivery can be 
delayed, the PNR curve 

indicates that project 
costs can be reduced 
substantially. 
   As the project deadline 

becomes tighter and 
tighter, you reach 

a point at which 
the work cannot 
be completed on 
schedule, regardless of 
the number of people 
doing the work. Face 
reality and deﬁ ne a 

new delivery date.
