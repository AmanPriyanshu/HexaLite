CHAPTER 14  
COMPONENT-LEVEL DESIGN
 287accomplish this, you begin with the analysis model and elaborate analysis classes (for components that relate to the problem domain) and infrastructure classes 
(for components that provide support services for the problem domain).   
To illustrate this process of design elaboration, consider software to be built 
for a sophisticated print shop. The overall intent of the software is to collect the 
customer’s requirements at the front counter, cost a print job, and then pass the 

job on to an automated production facility. During requirements engineering, 

an analysis class called  PrintJob 
 was derived. The attributes and operations de-
ﬁ ned during analysis are noted at the top of  
Figure 14.1 . During architectural design,  PrintJob 
 is deﬁ ned as a component within the software architecture and 
is represented using the shorthand UML notation  2 
 
 shown in the middle right of
