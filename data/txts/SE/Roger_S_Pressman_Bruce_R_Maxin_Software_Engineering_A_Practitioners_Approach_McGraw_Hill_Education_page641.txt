FORMAL MODELING AND VERIFICATION

Test cases are generated for each set of stimuli 
 4 
 
 according to the usage proba-
bility distribution. To illustrate, consider the  
SafeHome 
 system discussed earlier 
in this book. Cleanroom software engineering is being used to develop a software 
increment that manages user interaction with the security system keypad. Five 
stimuli have been identiﬁ ed for this increment. Analysis indicates the percent 
probability distribution of each stimulus. To make selection of test cases easier, 

these probabilities are mapped into intervals numbered between 1 and 99 [Lin94] 
and illustrated in the following table:  Program Stimulus
Probability (%)
Interval
Arm/disarm (AD)50
Zone set (ZS)1550–63

Query (Q)1564–78

Test (T)1579–94
Panic alarm
95–99 To generate a sequence of usage test cases that conform to the usage probabil-
ity distribution, random numbers between 1 and 99 are generated. Each random 
number corresponds to an interval on the preceding probability distribution. 
Hence, the sequence of usage test cases is deﬁ ned randomly but corresponds 
to the appropriate probability of stimuli occurrence. For example, assume the 
following random-number sequences are generated:  
 
 
13-94-22-24-45-56    
 
81-19-31-69-45-9    
 
 
 
 
38-21-52-84-86-4  
 
  Selecting the appropriate stimuli based on the distribution interval shown in the table, the following use cases are derived:  
 
 
 
 
AD–T–AD–AD–AD–ZS    
 
 
 
 
T–AD–AD–AD–Q–AD–AD    
 
 
 
 
AD–AD–ZS–T–T–AD  
 
  The testing team executes these use cases and veriﬁ es software behavior against 
the speciﬁ cation for the system. Timing for tests is recorded so that interval times 
may be determined. Using interval times, the certiﬁ cation team can compute 
mean-time-to-failure. If a long sequence of tests is conducted without failure, the 
MTTF is low and software reliability may be assumed high.     Unlike conventional 
testing, cleanroom 
approaches are 
statistically driven.
