CHAPTER 16  
PATTERN-BASED DESIGN
 369and team must solve. You need only specify pattern names and provide a one-sentence 
description for each pattern.    
 
16.7.  Find ﬁ ve patterns repositories and present an abbreviated description of the types of 
patterns contained in each.    
 
16.8.  When Christopher Alexander says “good design cannot be achieved simply by adding together performing parts,” what do you think he means?    
 
16.9.  Using the pattern-based design tasks noted in Section 16.2.3, develop a skeletal design for the “interior design system” described in Section 15.3.2.    
 
16.10.  Build a pattern-organizing table for the patterns you used in Problem 16.9.    
 
16.11.  Using the design pattern template presented in Section 16.1.3, develop a complete pattern description for the  Kitchen 
 pattern mentioned in Section 16.3.    
 
16.12.  The gang of four [Gam95] have proposed a variety of component patterns that are applicable to object-oriented systems. Select one (these are available on the Web) and dis-

cuss it.    
 
16.13.  Find three patterns repositories for user-interface patterns. Select one pattern from 
each and present an abbreviated description of it.    
 
16.14.  Find three patterns repositories for WebApp patterns. Select one pattern from each 
and present an abbreviated description of it.    
 
16.15.   Find three patterns repositories for mobile patterns. Select one pattern from each 
and present an abbreviated description of it.

 READINGS AND INFORMATION
 SOURCES  
 
Many books on pattern-based design have been written for software engineers. Gamma and his colleagues [Gam95] have written the seminal book on the subject. More recent con-
tributions include books by Burris ( Programming in the Large with Design Patterns,
 
 Pretty 
Print Press, 2012), Smith ( Elemental Design Patterns, 
 Addison-Wesley, 2012). Lasater ( 
Design Patterns, 
 Wordware Publishing, 2007), Holzner ( 
Design Patterns for Dummies, 
 For Dummies, 
2006), Freeman and her colleagues ( Head First Design Patterns, 
 O’Reilly Media, 2005), and 
Shalloway and Trott ( 
Design Patterns Explained, 
 2nd. ed., Addison-Wesley, 2004). Kent Beck 
( Implementation Patterns, 
 Addison-Wesley, 2008) addresses patterns for coding and imple-
mentation issues that are encountered during the construction activity. 
  
 
Other books focus on design patterns as they are supplied in speciﬁ c application de-
velopment and language environments. Contributions in this area include: Bowers and his 
colleagues ( Pro HTML5 and CSS3 Design Patterns,
 
 Apress, 2011), Scott and Neil ( 
Designing Web Interfaces: Principles and Patterns for Rich Interactions
 
, O’Reilly, 2009), Tropashko 
and Burleson ( SQL Design Patterns: Expert Guide to SQL Programming,
 
 Rampant Tech-
press, 2007), Mahemoff ( Ajax Design Patterns, 
 O’Reilly Media, 2006), Bevis ( 
Java Design Pattern Essentials, 
 Ability First Limited, 2010), Metsker and Wake ( 
Design Patterns in Java, 
 Addison-Wesley, 2006), Millett ( 
Professional ASP.NET Design Patterns,
 
 Wrox, 2010), 
Nilsson ( Applying Domain-Driven Design and Patterns: With Examples in C# and .NET,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 2006), Stefanov ( 
JavaScript Patterns, 
 O’Reilly, 2010), Sweat ( 
Architect’s 
Guide to PHP Design Patterns, 
 Marco Tabini & Associates, 2005), Paul ( 
Design Patterns in C# 
), Metsker ( Design Patterns C#, 
 Addison-Wesley, 2004), Grand and Merrill ( 
Visual Basic 
.NET Design Patterns, 
 Wiley, 2003), Crawford and Kaplan ( 
J2EE Design Patterns, 
 O’Reilly 
Media, 2003), Juric et al. ( J2EE Design Patterns Applied, 
 Wrox Press, 2002), and Marinescu 
and Roman ( EJB Design Patterns, 
 Wiley, 2002),
