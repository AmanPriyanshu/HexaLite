TESTING WEB APPLICATIONS

•  What values of  N, T,
 
 and  D 
 force the server environment to fail? How does failure manifest itself? Are automated notiﬁ cations sent to technical sup-
port staff at the server site?   
 
 
•  If the system does fail, how long will it take to come back online?   
 
 
•  Are certain WebApp functions (e.g., compute intensive functionality, data 
streaming capabilities) discontinued as capacity reaches the 80 or 90 per-

cent level?  
 
  A variation of stress testing is sometimes referred to as  spike/bounce testing 
 [Spl01]. In this testing regime, load is spiked to capacity, then lowered quickly to 

normal operating conditions, and then spiked again. By bouncing system load-
ing, you can determine how well the server can marshal resources to meet very 
high demand and then release them when normal conditions reappear (so that 
they are ready for the next spike).  
 
 
  
 
 
Web Performance Testing Tools 
  
 Objective: 
 The objective of Web 
performance testing tools is to look for 
bottlenecks that can cause poor performance or simulate 

conditions that may cause a website to fail completely. 
  Mechanics: 
 Online tools prompt you for the URL of a web resource. Some tools automatically conduct a series 
of simulated load tests. Some tools collect statistics on 
page loading and server response times as developers 

navigate the website.   Representative Tools:

UMMARY  
The goal of WebApp testing is to exercise each of the many dimensions of 
WebApp quality with the intent of ﬁ
 nding errors or uncovering issues that may 
lead to quality failures. Testing focuses on content, function, structure, usability, 

navigability, performance, compatibility, interoperability, capacity, and security.
