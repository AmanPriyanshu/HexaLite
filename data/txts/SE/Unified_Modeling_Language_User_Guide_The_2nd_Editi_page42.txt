 Relationships are discussed in Chapters 5 and 10. The Applet and Graphics classes are represented graphically as rectangular icons. No operations are shown for either of them, and so their icons are elided. The directed line with the hollow arrowhead from HelloWorld to Applet represents generalization, which in this case means that HelloWorld is a child of Applet. The dashed directed line from HelloWorld to Graphics represents a dependency relationship, which means that HelloWorld uses Graphics. This is not the end of the framework upon which HelloWorld is built. If you study the Java libraries for Applet and Graphics, you will discover that both of these classes are part of a larger hierarchy. Tracing just the classes that Applet extends and implements, you can generate another class diagram, shown in Figure 3-3. Figure 3-3 HelloWorld Inheritance Hierarchy  Note
