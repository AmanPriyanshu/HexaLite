RISK MANAGEMENT 783 
 
 
 3.
  Estimate the impact of the risk on the project and the product.   
 
 
 4.
  Assess the overall accuracy of the risk projection so that there will be no misunderstandings.  
 
  The intent of these steps is to consider risks in a manner that leads to priori-tization. No software team has the resources to address every possible risk with 
the same degree of rigor. By prioritizing risks, you can allocate resources where 

they will have the most impact.   
 
35.4.1   
Developing a Risk Table 
 
A risk table provides you with a simple technique for risk projection.

risk table is illustrated in

2  The risk table can be implemented as a spreadsheet model. This enables easy manipulation 
and sorting of the entries. pre22126_ch35_777-794.indd   783pre22126_ch35_777-794.indd   78313/12/13   6:17 PM13/12/13   6:17 PM
