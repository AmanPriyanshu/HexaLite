PART
 In this part of  Software Engineering: A Practitioner’s Approach
 
 you’ll learn about the principles, concepts, and methods that are 

used to create high-quality requirements and design  models. 
These questions are addressed in the chapters that follow:  
 
 
•  What concepts and principles guide software engineering practice?    
 •  What is requirements engineering and what are the under-
lying concepts that lead to good requirements analysis?    
 •  How is the requirements model created and what are its elements?    
 •  What are the elements of a good design?    
 •  How does architectural design establish a framework for all other design actions and what models are used?    
 •  How do we design high-quality software components?    
 •  What concepts, models, and methods are applied as a user interface is designed?    
 •  What is pattern-based design?    
 •  What specialized strategies and methods are used to  design WebApps? 
   
 •  What specialized strategies and methods are used to  design mobile apps?  
 
  Once these questions are answered you’ll be better prepared to apply software engineering practice.  MODELING pre22126_ch07_103-130.indd   103pre22126_ch07_103-130.indd   10313/12/13   6:11 PM13/12/13   6:11 PM
