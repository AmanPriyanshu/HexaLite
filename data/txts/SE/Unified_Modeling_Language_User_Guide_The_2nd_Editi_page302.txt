be implemented by one or more components, and, in turn, a component may be deployed on one or more nodes. As Figure 26-3 shows, the relationship between a node and the components it deploys can be shown explicitly by using a dependency relationship. Most of the time, you won't need to visualize these relationships graphically but will keep them as a part of the node's specification. Figure 26-3 Nodes and Components  A set of objects or components that are allocated to a node as a group is called a distribution unit. Note Nodes are also class-like in that you can specify attributes and operations for them. For example, you might specify that a node provides the attributes processorSpeed and memory, as well as the operations turnOn, turnOff, and suspend.  Organizing Nodes Packages are discussed in Chapter 12. You can organize nodes by grouping them in packages in the same manner in which you can organize classes and components.
