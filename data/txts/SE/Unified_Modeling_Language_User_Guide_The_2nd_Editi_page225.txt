eventually be implemented by one or more classes. In an activity diagram partitioned into swimlanes, every activity belongs to exactly one swimlane, but transitions may cross lanes. Note There's a loose connection between swimlanes and concurrent flows of control. Conceptually, the activities of each swimlane are generally#but not always#considered separate from the activities of neighboring swimlanes. That makes sense because, in the real world, the business organizations that generally map to these swimlanes are independent and concurrent.  Object Flow Objects are discussed in Chapter 13 ; modeling the vocabulary of a system is discussed in Chapter 4. Objects may be involved in the flow of control associated with an activity diagram. For example, in the workflow of processing an order as in the previous figure, the vocabulary of your problem space will also include such classes as Order and Bill. Instances of these two classes will be produced by certain activities (Process order will create an Order object, for example); other activities may modify these objects (for example, Ship order will change the state of the Order object to filled). Dependency relationships are discussed in Chapters 5 and 10. As Figure 19-8 shows, you can specify the things that are involved in an activity diagram by placing these objects in the diagram, connected using a dependency to the activity or transition that creates, destroys, or modifies them. This use of dependency relationships and objects is called an object flow because it represents the participation of an object in a flow of control. Figure 19-8 Object Flow
