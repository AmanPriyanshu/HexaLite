˚˛˝˙ˆˇ˘˜˜˜˜˜˜The Operation state includes a number of substates. It shows that operation starts with a status check and that if any problems are discovered an alarm is indicated and operation is disabled. Cooking involves running the microwave generator for the 

specified time; on completion, a buzzer is sounded. If the door is opened during 

operation, the system moves to the disabled state, as shown in Figure 5.17.State models of a system provide an overview of event processing, but you nor-mally have to extend this with a more detailed description of the stimuli and the system 

states. You may use a table to list the states and events that stimulate state transitions 

along with a description of each state and event. Figure 5.18 shows a tabular descrip-
tion of each state and how the stimuli that force state transitions are generated.ˇˇModel-driven engineering (MDE) is an approach to software development whereby 
models rather than programs are the principal outputs of the development process
