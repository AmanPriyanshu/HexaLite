 CONTENT TESTING  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Errors in WebApp content can be as trivial as minor typographical mistakes or as 
signiﬁ cant as incorrect information, improper organization, or violation of intel-
lectual property laws.  Content testing 
 attempts to uncover these and many other 
problems before the user encounters them.  Content testing combines both reviews and the generation of executable test cases. Review is applied to uncover semantic errors in content (discussed in 
Section 25.3.1). Executable testing is used to uncover content errors that can be 
traced to dynamically derived content that is driven by data acquired from one 
or more databases.

Content Testing Objectives 
 
Content testing has three important objectives: (1) to uncover syntactic errors (e.g., typos, grammar mistakes) in text-based documents, graphical representa-
tions, and other media; (2) to uncover semantic errors (i.e., errors in the accuracy 
or completeness of information) in any content object presented as navigation 
occurs, and (3) to ﬁ nd errors in the organization or structure of content that is 
presented to the end user. 
   Although technical re-
views are not a part of 

testing, content review 
should be performed 

to ensure that content 
has quality. 
   Content testing objects 

are: (1) to uncover 
syntactic errors in con-

tent, (2) to uncover 
semantic errors, and 

(3) to ﬁ nd structural 

errors.
