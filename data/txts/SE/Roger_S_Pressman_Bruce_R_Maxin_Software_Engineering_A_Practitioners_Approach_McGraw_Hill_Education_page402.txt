MODELINGhundreds or thousands of content objects, functions, and analysis classes; and when the success of the WebApp will have a direct impact on the success of the 

business, design cannot and should not be taken lightly. 
 This reality leads us to Nielsen’s second approach—“the engineering ideal 
of solving a problem for a customer.” Web engineering

 adopts this philoso-
phy, and a more rigorous approach to WebApp design enables developers to 

achieve it.

WEBAPP DESIGN QUALITY  
 
Every person who has surfed the Web has an opinion about what makes a “good” 
WebApp. Individual viewpoints vary widely. Some users enjoy ﬂ
 ashy graphics; 
others want simple text. Some demand copious information; others desire an 
abbreviated presentation. Some like sophisticated analytical tools or database 
access; others like to keep it simple. In fact, the user’s perception of “goodness” 

(and the resultant acceptance or rejection of the WebApp as a consequence) 

might be more important than any technical discussion of WebApp quality. 
 But how is WebApp quality perceived? What attributes must be exhibited to 
achieve goodness in the eyes of end users and at the same time exhibit the tech-
nical characteristics of quality that will enable you to correct, adapt, enhance, 
and support the WebApp over the long term? 
 In reality, all of the technical characteristics of design quality discussed in 
Chapter 12 and the generic quality attributes presented in Chapter 19 apply 
to WebApps. However, the most relevant of these generic attributes—usability, 

functionality, reliability, efﬁ
 ciency, and maintainability—provide a useful basis 
for assessing the quality of Web-based systems. 
 Olsina and his colleagues [Ols99] have prepared a “quality requirement tree” that identiﬁ es a set of technical attributes—usability, functionality, reliability, 
efﬁ ciency, and maintainability—that lead to high-quality WebApps.

  Figure 17.1  summarizes their work. The criteria noted in the ﬁ gure are of particular interest 
if you design, build, and maintain WebApps over the long term. 
 
 
 
 
   
Offutt [Off02] extends the ﬁ ve major quality attributes noted in  
Figure 17.1  by 
adding the following attributes:

 [Pre08] is an adapted version of the software engineering approach that is 
presented throughout this book. It proposes an agile, yet disciplined framework for building 
industry-quality Web-based systems and applications.

cation: quality characteristics are universal for all software. pre22126_ch17_371-390.indd   372pre22126_ch17_371-390.indd   37213/12/13   6:13 PM13/12/13   6:13 PM
