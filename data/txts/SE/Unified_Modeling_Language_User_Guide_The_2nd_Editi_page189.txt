 Stereotypes are discussed in Chapter 6. Note You can use the UML's extensibility mechanisms to stereotype an actor in order to provide a different icon that might offer a better visual cue for your purposes.  Association relationships are discussed in Chapters 5and 10; messages are discussed in Chapter 15. Actors may be connected to use cases only by association. An association between an actor and a use case indicates that the actor and the use case communicate with one another, each one possibly sending and receiving messages. Use Cases and Flow of Events A use case describes what a system (or a subsystem, class, or interface) does but it does not specify how it does it. When you model, it's important that you keep clear the separation of concerns between this outside and inside view. You can specify the behavior of a use case by describing a flow of events in text clearly enough for an outsider to understand it easily. When you write this flow of events, you should include how and when the use case starts and ends, when the use case interacts with the actors and what objects are exchanged, and the basic flow and alternative flows of the behavior. For example, in the context of an ATM system, you might describe the use case ValidateUser in the following way:
