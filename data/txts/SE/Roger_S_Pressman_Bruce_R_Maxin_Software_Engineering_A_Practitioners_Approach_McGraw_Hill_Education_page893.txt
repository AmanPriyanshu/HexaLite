phrase for describing the use of computers in a business context. Today, data pro-
cessing has given way to another phrase— 
information technology
 
—that implies 
the same thing but presents a subtle shift in focus. The emphasis is not merely 
to process large quantities of data but rather to extract meaningful information 
from this data. Obviously, this was always the intent, but the shift in terminology 
reﬂ
 ects a far more important shift in management philosophy. 
 
 
 
 
When software applications are discussed today, the words  
data, informa-
tion, 
 
and 
 content
 
 occur repeatedly. We encounter the word  
knowledge
 
 in some 
 
artiﬁ
 cial intelligence
 applications, but its use is relatively rare. Virtually no one 
discusses  
wisdom
 
 in the context of software applications. 
 
Data is raw information—collections of facts that must be processed to be 
meaningful. Information is derived by associating facts within a given context. 
Knowledge associates information obtained in one context with other informa-
tion obtained in a different context. Finally, wisdom occurs when generalized 
principles are derived from disparate knowledge. Each of these four views of 
“information” is represented schematically in

To date, the vast majority of all software has been built to process data or 
information. Software engineers are now equally concerned with systems that 
process knowledge.

 Knowledge is two-dimensional. Information collected on a 
variety of related and unrelated topics is connected to form a body of fact that we 
call  
knowledge.
 
 The key is our ability to associate information from a variety of 
different sources that may not have any obvious connection and combine it in a 
way that provides us with some distinct beneﬁ
 t.

existing knowledge
from different sources

 The rapid growth of data mining and data warehousing technologies reﬂ
 ect this growing trend.

 The semantic Web (Web 2.0) allows the creation of “mashups” that may provide a facile mecha-
nism for achieving this.
