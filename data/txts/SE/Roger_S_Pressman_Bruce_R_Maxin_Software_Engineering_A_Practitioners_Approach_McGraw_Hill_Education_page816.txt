MANAGING SOFTWARE PROJECTS
much of the project will be affected or how many stakeholders are harmed?). Fi-nally, the timing of a risk considers when and for how long the impact will be felt. 

In most cases, you want the “bad news” to occur as soon as possible, but in some 
cases, the longer the delay, the better. 
 
 
 
   
Returning once more to the risk analysis approach proposed by the U.S. Air Force [AFC88], you can apply the following steps to determine the overall conse-
quences of a risk: (1) determine the average probability of occurrence value for 
each risk component; (2) using   
Figure 35.1  
, determine the impact for each com-ponent based on the criteria shown, and (3) complete the risk table and analyze 
the results as described in the preceding sections.  The overall  risk exposure,
 
 RE, is determined using the following relationship 
  [Hal98]:RE 5  P 
 3  C 
  where  P 
 is the probability of occurrence for a risk, and  
C 
 is the cost to the project 
should the risk occur. 
 For example, assume that the software team deﬁ nes a project risk in the fol-
lowing manner:

  Only 70 percent of the software components sched-
uled for reuse will, in fact, be integrated into the application. The remain-

Risk impact. 
  Sixty reusable software components were planned. If only 
70 percent can be used, 18 components would have to be developed from 
scratch (in addition to other custom software that has been scheduled for 
development). Since the average component is 100 LOC and local data 
indicate that the software engineering cost for each LOC is $14.00, the 
overall cost (impact) to develop the components would be 18 3 100 3 14 5 $25,200.

Risk exposure can be computed for each risk in the risk table, once an estimate of the cost of the risk is made. The total risk exposure for all risks (above the cut-
off in the risk table) can provide a means for adjusting the ﬁ nal cost estimate for 
a project. It can also be used to predict the probable increase in staff resources 
required at various points during the project schedule.  The risk projection and analysis techniques described in Sections 35.4.1 and 35.4.2 are applied iteratively as the software project proceeds.  4 
 
 The project 
team should revisit the risk table at regular intervals, reevaluating each risk to  How do we 
assess the consequences of 
a risk? ?   Compare RE for all 

risks to the cost 
estimate for the 
project. If RE is greater 

the project cost, the 
viability of the project 
must be evaluated.
