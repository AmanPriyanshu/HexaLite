of one class to an object of the other class, and vice versa. It's quite legal to have both ends of an association circle back to the same class. This means that, given an object of the class, you can link to other objects of the same class. An association that connects exactly two classes is called a binary association. Although it's not as common, you can have associations that connect more than two classes; these are called n-ary associations. Graphically, an association is rendered as a solid line connecting the same or different classes. Use associations when you want to show structural relationships. Beyond this basic form, there are four adornments that apply to associations. Don't confuse name direction with association navigation, as discussed in Chapter 10. Name   An association can have a name, and you use that name to describe the nature of the relationship. So that there is no ambiguity about its meaning, you can give a direction to the name by providing a direction triangle that points in the direction you intend to read the name, as shown in Figure 5-4. Figure 5-4 Association Names  Note Although an association may have a name, you typically don't need to include one if you explicitly provide role names for the association, or if you have a model with many associations and you need to refer to or distinguish among associations. This is especially true when you have more than one association connecting the same classes.  Roles are related to the semantics of interfaces, as discussed in Chapter 11. Role   When a class participates in an association, it has a specific role that it plays in that relationship; a role is just the face the class at the near end of the association presents to the class at the other end of the association. You can explicitly name the role a class plays in an association. In Figure 5-5, a Person playing the role of employee is associated with a Company playing the role of employer. Figure 5-5 Roles
