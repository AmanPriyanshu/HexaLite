 Responsibilities Responsibilities are an example of a defined stereotype , as discussed in Chapter 6. A responsibility is a contract or an obligation of a class. When you create a class, you are making a statement that all objects of that class have the same kind of state and the same kind of behavior. At a more abstract level, these corresponding attributes and operations are just the features by which the class's responsibilities are carried out. A Wall class is responsible for knowing about height, width, and thickness; a FraudAgent class, as you might find in a credit card application, is responsible for processing orders and determining if they are legitimate, suspect, or fraudulent; a TemperatureSensor class is responsible for measuring temperature and raising an alarm if the temperature reaches a certain point. Modeling the semantics of aclass is discussed in Chapter 9. When you model classes, a good starting point is to specify the responsibilities of the things in your vocabulary. Techniques like CRC cards and use case-based analysis are especially helpful here. A class may have any number of responsibilities, although, in practice, every well-structured class has at least one responsibility and at most just a handful. As you refine your models, you will translate these responsibilities into a set of attributes and operations that best fulfill the class's responsibilities. You can also draw the responsibilities of a class in a note, as discussed in Chapter 6. Graphically, responsibilities can be drawn in a separate compartment at the bottom of the class icon, as shown in Figure 4-8. Figure 4-8 Responsibilities
