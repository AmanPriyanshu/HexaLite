CHAPTER 13  
ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN 269 
 
As part of the architectural design, the details of each interface shown in   
Figure 13.6  would have to be speciﬁ
 ed. All data that ﬂ
 ow into and out of the target 
system must be identiﬁ ed at this stage. 
 
 
 
13.6.2  Deﬁ
 ning Archetypes 
 
An  archetype
 
 is a class or pattern that represents a core abstraction that is criti-cal to the design of an architecture for the target system. In general, a relatively 
small set of archetypes is required to design even relatively complex systems. 
The target system architecture is composed of these archetypes, which repre-
sent stable elements of the architecture but may be instantiated many different 
ways based on the behavior of the system.   
 
 
 
 
In many cases, archetypes can be derived by examining the analysis classes deﬁ ned as part of the requirements model. Continuing the discussion of the 
 SafeHome 
 home security function, you might deﬁ ne the following archetypes:
 
 
 
 
•   
Node. 
 Represents a cohesive collection of input and output elements of the home security function. For example, a node might be composed of 
  
 
 
•   
Detector.
 
 An abstraction that encompasses all sensing equipment that feeds information into the target system.   
 
 
•   
Indicator.
 
 An abstraction that represents all mechanisms (e.g., alarm siren, ﬂ ashing lights, bell) for indicating that an alarm condition is occurring. 
  
 
 
•   
Controller.
 
 An abstraction that depicts the mechanism that allows the arming or disarming of a node. If controllers reside on a network, they 
have the ability to communicate with one another. 
    Archetypes are the 
abstract building blocks 
of an architectural 
design. Target system:
