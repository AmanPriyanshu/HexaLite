MODELING 
 
9.3.1 Developing an Activity Diagram 
 
The UML activity diagram supplements the use case by providing a graphical representation of the ﬂ ow of interaction within a speciﬁ
 c scenario. Similar to the 
ﬂ owchart, an activity diagram uses rounded rectangles to imply a speciﬁ
 c system 
function, arrows to represent ﬂ ow through the system, decision diamonds to de-
pict a branching decision (each arrow emanating from the diamond is labeled), 
and solid horizontal lines to indicate that parallel activities are occurring. An 
activity diagram for the  ACS-DCV 
 use case is shown in  
Figure 9.5 . It should be noted that the activity diagram adds additional detail not directly mentioned 
(but implied) by the use case. For example, a user may only attempt to enter 
  
userID 
 and  
password 
 a limited number of times. This is represented by a deci-
sion diamond below “Prompt for reentry.”
