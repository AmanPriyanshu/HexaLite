from each channel differ, the system shuts down. For many medical treatment and diagnostic systems, reliability is more important than availability because an incor-
rect system response could lead to the patient receiving incorrect treatment. However, 

if the system shuts down in the event of an error, this is an inconvenience but the 
patient will not usually be harmed.In situations that require high availability, you have to use several self-checking 
systems in parallel. You need a switching unit that detects faults and selects a 

result from one of the systems, where both channels are producing a consistent 

response. This approach is used in the flight control system for the Airbus 340 

series of aircraft, which uses five self-checking computers. Figure 11.8 is a simpli-
fied diagram of the Airbus flight control system that shows the organization of the 

self-monitoring systems.In the Airbus flight control system, each of the flight control computers carries out 
the computations in parallel, using the same inputs. The outputs are connected to 

hardware filters that detect if the status indicates a fault and, if so, that the output from 

that computer is switched off. The output is then taken from an alternative system. 

Therefore, it is possible for four computers to fail and for the aircraft operation to 

continue. In more than 15 years of operation, there have been no reports of situations 

where control of the aircraft has been lost due to total flight control system failure.SplitterChannel 1Channel 2
