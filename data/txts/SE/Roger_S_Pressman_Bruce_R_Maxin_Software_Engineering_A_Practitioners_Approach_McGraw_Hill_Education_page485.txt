CHAPTER 21  
SOFTWARE QUALITY ASSURANCE
 455result. SQA analyzes the allocation of resources for reviews and testing to assess whether they are being allocated in the most effective manner. 
  
Figure 21.1  (adapted from [Hya96]) identiÔ¨Å es the attributes that are indicators 
for the existence of quality for each of the goals discussed. Metrics that can be 
used to indicate the relative strength of an attribute are also shown.
