CHAPTER 37  
SOFTWARE PROCESS IMPROVEMENT
 837organizational culture, an SPI strategy that has been customized for local needs, and solid management of the SPI project.  A number of SPI frameworks are in use today. The SEI’s CMM and CMMI are 
widely used. The People CMM has been customized to assess the quality of the 
organizational culture and the people who populate it. SPICE, Bootstrap, PSP, 

TSP, and TickIT are additional frameworks that can lead to effective SPI. 
 SPI is hard work that requires substantial investment of dollars and people. To ensure that a reasonable return on investment is achieved, an organization 

must measure the costs associated with SPI and the beneﬁ ts that can be directly 
attributed to it.

ROBLEMS AND POINTS TO PONDER  
 
 
 
37.1.  Why is it that software organizations often struggle when they embark on an effort to improve local software process?    
 
37.2.  Describe the concept of “process maturity” in your own words.    
 
37.3.  Do some research (check the SEI website) and determine the process maturity distri-bution for software organizations in the United States and worldwide.    
 
37.4.  You work for a very small software organization—only 11 people are involved in devel-
oping software. Is SPI for you? Explain your answer. 
   
 
37.5.  Assessment is analogous to an annual physical exam. Using a physical exam as a met-aphor, describe the SPI assessment activity. 
   
 
37.6.  What is the difference between an “as is” process, a “here to there” process, and a “to be” process?    
 
37.7.  How is risk management applied within the context of SPI?    
 
37.8.  Select one of the critical success factors noted in Section 37.2.7. Do some research and write a brief paper on how it can be achieved.    
 
37.9.  Do some research and explain how the CMMI differs from its predecessor, the CMM. 
   
 
37.10.  Select one of the SPI frameworks discussed in Section 37.5, and write a brief paper describing it in more detail.

 READINGS AND INFORMATION
 SOURCES  
 
One of the most readily accessible and comprehensive resources for information on SPI has been developed by the Software Engineering Institute and is available at  www.sei.cmu.edu
 
 and  www.cmmiinstitute.com
 
. The SEI websites contain hundreds of papers, studies, and de-tailed SPI framework descriptions.   
 
Over the past few years, a number of worthwhile books have been added to a broad litera-ture developed during the past two decades. Chrissis and her colleagues ( CMMI for Develop-ment: Guidelines for Process Integration and Product Improvement
 
, 3rd ed.,  Addison-Wesley, 
2011) and McMahin ( Integrating CMMI and Agile Development, 
  Addison-Wesley, 2010) dis-
cuss the application of CCMI in modern software development. Land  (Jumpstart CMM/CMMI Software Process Improvements,
 
 Wiley-IEEE Computer Society, 2007) melds the re-
quirements deﬁ ned as part of the SEI CMM and CMMI with IEEE software engineering stan-
dards with an emphasis on the intersection of process and practice. Micklewright ( Lean pre22126_ch37_817-838.indd   837pre22126_ch37_817-838.indd   83713/12/13   6:17 PM13/12/13   6:17 PM
