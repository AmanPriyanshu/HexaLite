MANAGING SOFTWARE PROJECTS
 
A cost-beneﬁ t analysis model for reengineering has been proposed by Sneed 
[Sne95]. Nine parameters are deﬁ ned: 
  
 
 
 
 
P 
 1 
 5 Current annual maintenance cost for an application    
 
 
 
P 
 2 
 5 Current annual operations cost for an application    
 
 
 
P 
 3  
5 Current annual business value of an application    
 
 
 
P

 5 Predicted annual maintenance cost after reengineering

  The cost associated with continuing maintenance of a candidate application (i.e., reengineering is not performed) can be deﬁ ned as 
  
 
C

  The costs associated with reengineering are deﬁ ned using the following 
relationship:

  Using the costs presented in Equations (36.1) and (36.2), the overall beneﬁ t of re-
engineering can be computed as   
Cost beneﬁ t

 (36.3) 
 
  The cost-beneﬁ t analysis presented in these equations can be performed for all 
high-priority applications identiﬁ ed during inventory analysis (Section 36.4.2). 
Those applications that show the highest cost-beneﬁ t can be targeted for reengi-
neering, while work on others can be postponed until resources are available.

Software maintenance and support are ongoing activities that occur throughout the life cycle of an application. During these activities, defects are corrected, 
applications are adapted to a changing operational or business environment, en-
hancements are implemented at the request of stakeholders, and users are sup-
ported as they integrate an application into their personal or business workﬂ ow. 
 Reengineering occurs at two different levels of abstraction. At the business level, reengineering focuses on the business process with the intent of making 
changes to improve competitiveness in some area of the business. At the soft-
ware level, reengineering examines information systems and applications with 
the intent of restructuring or reconstructing them so that they exhibit higher 
quality.
