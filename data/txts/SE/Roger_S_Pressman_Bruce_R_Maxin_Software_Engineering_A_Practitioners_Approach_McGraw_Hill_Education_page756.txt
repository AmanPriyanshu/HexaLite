MANAGING SOFTWARE PROJECTS
the context of ISO and CMMI standards. Kan ( Metrics and Models in Software Quality Engi-
neering, 
 2nd ed., Addison-Wesley, 2002) presents a collection of relevant metrics. 
 Ebert and Dumke ( Software Measurement,
 
 Springer, 2007) provide a useful treatment of 
measurement and metrics as they should be applied for IT projects. McGarry and his col-
leagues ( Practical Software Measurement,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 2001) present in-depth advice 
for assessing the software process. A worthwhile collection of papers has been edited by 
Haug and his colleagues ( Software Process Improvement: Metrics, Measurement, and Pro-
cess Modeling, 
 Springer-Verlag, 2001). Florac and Carlton ( 
Measuring the Software Process,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 1999) and Fenton and Pﬂ
 eeger ( 
Software Metrics: A Rigorous and Practical 
Approach,
 
 Revised, Brooks/Cole Publishers, 1998) discuss how software metrics can be used 
to provide the indicators necessary to improve the software process.  Wohlin and his colleagues ( 
Experimentation in Software Engineering,
 
 Springer, 2012) dis-
cusses the manner in which measures used in analyzing software process. Jones ( Applied Software Measurement: Global Analysis of Productivity and Quality,
 
 McGraw-Hill, 2008), 
Laird and Brennan ( Software Measurement and Estimation,
 
 Wiley-IEEE Computer Society 
Press, 2006), and Goodman ( Software Metrics: Best Practices for Successful IT Management
 
, Rothstein Associates, 2004) discuss the use of software metrics for project management and 
estimation. Putnam and Myers ( Five Core Metrics,
 
 Dorset House, 2003) draw on a database 
of more than the 6,000 software projects to demonstrate how ﬁ ve core metrics—time, effort, 
size, reliability, and process productivity—can be used to control software projects. Max-

well ( Applied Statistics for Software Managers,
 
 Prentice Hall, 2003) presents techniques for 
analyzing software project data. Munson ( Software Engineering Measurement,
 
 Auerbach, 
2003) discusses a broad array of software engineering measurement issues. Jones ( Software 
Assessments, Benchmarks and Best Practices, 
 Addison-Wesley, 2000) describes both quan-
titative measurement and qualitative factors that help an organization assess its software 
process and practices.  Function point measurement has become a widely used technique in many areas of soft-ware engineering work. The International Function Point Users Group published a collec-
tion of papers on the use of function point metrics ( The IFPUC Guide to IT and Software 
Measurement,
 
 Auerbach, 2012). Parthasarathy ( 
Practical Software Estimation: Function 
Point Methods for Insourced and Outsourced Projects,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 2007) provide a com-
prehensive guide. Garmus and Herron ( Function Point Analysis: Measurement Practices for 
Successful Software Projects,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 2000) discuss process metrics with an empha-
sis on function point analysis.  Relatively little has been published on metrics for Web engineering work, Clifton 
(  
Advanced Web Metrics with Google Analytics,
 
 3rd ed., Sybex, 2012), However, Kaushik ( 
Web 
Analytics 2.0: Accountability and Science of Customer Centricity 
, Sybex, 2009) and  (Web 
 Analytics: An Hour a Day,
 
 Sybex, 2007), Stern ( 
Web Metrics: Proven Methods for Measur-
ing Web Site Success,
 
 Wiley, 2002), Inan and Kean ( 
Measuring the Success of Your Website,
 
  Longman, 2002), and Nobles and Grady ( Web Site Analysis and Reporting,
 
 Premier Press, 
2001) address Web metrics from a business and marketing perspective. 
 The latest research in the metrics area is summarized by the IEEE ( Symposium on Software Metrics,
 
 published yearly). A wide variety of information sources on the process 
and project metrics is available on the Internet. An up-to-date list of World Wide Web 

references can be found under “software engineering resources” at the SEPA website:
