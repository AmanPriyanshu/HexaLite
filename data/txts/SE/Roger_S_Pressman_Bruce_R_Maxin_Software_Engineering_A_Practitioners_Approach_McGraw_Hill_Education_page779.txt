CHAPTER 33  
ESTIMATION FOR SOFTWARE PROJECTS
 749apps), it is less expensive to purchase and experiment than to conduct a lengthy evaluation of potential software packages. In the ﬁ nal analysis, the make/buy 
decision is made based on the following conditions: (1) Will the delivery date 

of the software product be sooner than that for internally developed software? 
ill the cost of acquisition plus the cost of customization be less than the cost 

of developing the software internally? (3) Will the cost of outside support (e.g., a 

maintenance contract) be less than the cost of internal support? These condi-
tions apply for each of the acquisition options.

Creating a Decision Tree 
 
The steps just described can be augmented using statistical techniques such as decision tree analysis.  14 
 
 For example,  
 
Figure 33.5  
 depicts a decision tree for a 
software-based system X. In this case, the software engineering organization can 
(1) build system X from scratch, (2) reuse existing partial-experience components 
to construct the system, (3) buy an available software product and modify it to 
meet local needs, or (4) contract the software development to an outside 
vendor. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  If the system is to be built from scratch, there is a 70 percent probability that the job will be difﬁ cult. Using the estimation techniques discussed previously in 
this chapter, the project planner projects that a difﬁ
 cult development effort will
