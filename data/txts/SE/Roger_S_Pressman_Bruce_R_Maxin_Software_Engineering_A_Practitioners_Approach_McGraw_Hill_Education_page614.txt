CHAPTER 
 
 
 
 
 
 Devanbu and Stubblebine [Dev00] make the following comment as an introduction to their roadmap for security engineering:  
Is there such a thing anymore as a software system that doesn’t need to be secure? Almost every software controlled system faces threats from potential ad-
versaries, from Internet-aware client applications running on PCs, to complex 
telecommunications and power systems accessible over the Internet, to commod-
ity software with copy protection mechanisms. Software engineers must be cog-
nizant of these threats and engineer systems with credible defenses, while still 
delivering value to customers.   
 
The threats that the authors discussed more than a decade ago have multiplied with the explosive growth of the Web, the ubiquitous presence of 

mobile applications, and the widespread use of the cloud. Each of these tech-
nologies has raised new concerns about user privacy and the potential loss 
or theft of personal information. Security is not just a concern to the people SECURITYENGINEERING 27  KEY CONCEPTS     asset  . . . . . . . . . . 585

What is it?   Security engineers build systems that have the ability 
to protect their assets from attack. 
Using threat analysis, you can de-termine the controls required to reduce the ex-

posure that results when attacks exploit system 
vulnerabilities. Security is an essential prereq-
uisite for software quality factors such as integ-
rity, availability, reliability, and safety. 
  
 
Who does it?   Software engineers working with customers and any other stakeholders who rely 
on the system results or services. 
  
 
Why is it important? 
  Each emerging technol-ogy brings new concerns about user privacy 

and the potential loss or theft of valuable in-
formation. Security is not just a concern to the 

people developing software for the military, 

government, or health agencies. Today, se-

curity must be the concern of every software 

engineer who has client resources to protect.   
 
What are the steps?   First, system assets are identiﬁ ed and the exposure to loss due to 
security breach is determined. The system ar-
chitecture is then modeled at the component 
level. Next, a security requirements speciﬁ ca-
tion and a risk mitigation plan are created. As 
the system is constructed, security assurance is 
preformed and continues throughout the soft-

ware process.   
 
What is the work product? 
  The primary 
work products are a security speciﬁ cation 
(which may be part of a requirements model) 

and a documented security case that is part 

of the system quality assurance documents. To 

develop these work products, a threat model 
and security risk assessment and risk mitiga-
tion plan are also created.   
 
How do I ensure I have done it right?   Use the evidence resulting from security reviews, 
inspections, and test results and present it as 
a security case that allows system stakeholders 
to assess their degree of trust that the system 
protects its assets and preserves stakeholder 

privacy.
