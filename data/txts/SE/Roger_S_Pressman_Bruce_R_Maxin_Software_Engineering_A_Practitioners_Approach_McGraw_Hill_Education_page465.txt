REVIEW TECHNIQUES 435 
To conduct reviews, you must expend time and effort, and your development 
organization must spend money. However, the results of the preceding example 

leave little doubt that you can pay now or pay much more later.

EVIEW METRICS AND THEIR USE  
 
Technical reviews are one of many actions that are required as part of good soft-
ware engineering practice. Each action requires dedicated human effort. Since 
available project effort is ﬁ nite, it is important for a software engineering organi-
zation to understand the effectiveness of each action by deﬁ ning a set of metrics 
(Chapter 30) that can be used to assess their efﬁ cacy. 
 Although many metrics can be deﬁ ned for technical reviews, a relatively small 
subset can provide useful insight. The following review metrics can be collected 
for each review that is conducted:  
 
 
•   
Preparation effort, E
p 
—the effort (in person-hours) required to review a work product prior to the actual review meeting   
 
 
•   
Assessment effort, Ea 
— the effort (in person-hours) that is expended during the actual review   
 
 
•   
Rework effort, Er 
— the effort (in person-hours) that is dedicated to the correction of those errors uncovered during the review   
 
 
•   
Work product size, WPS
 
—a measure of the size of the work product that has been reviewed (e.g., the number of UML models, or the number of 
document pages, or the number of lines of code)   
 
 
•   
Minor errors found, Err
minor 
—the number of errors found that can be cate-gorized as minor (requiring less than some prespeciﬁ ed effort to correct) 
  
 
 
•   
Major errors found, Err
major 
—the number of errors found that can be cate-gorized as major (requiring more than some prespeciﬁ ed effort to correct) 
 
 
  These metrics can be further reﬁ ned by associating the type of work product that 
was reviewed for the metrics collected.   
 
20.3.1   Analyzing Metrics 
 
Before analysis can begin, a few simple computations must occur. The total re-
view effort and the total number of errors discovered are deﬁ ned as:
 E review 5  Ep 
 1  Ea

Error density
 
 represents the errors found per unit of work product reviewed.  Error density 5   Errtot ______ WPS   pre22126_ch20_431-447.indd   435pre22126_ch20_431-447.indd   43513/12/13   10:01 PM13/12/13   10:01 PM
