3. Configuration services that are used to adapt the environment with a specific set 
of application services and to define how services are shared between students, 
teachers, and their parents.The environment has been designed so that services can be replaced as new ser-vices become available and to provide different versions of the system that are suited 

for the age of the users. This means that the system has to support two levels of ser-
vice integration:1. Integrated services are services that offer an API (application programming 
interface) and that can be accessed by other services through that API. Direct 
service-to-service communication is therefore possible. An authentication ser
-
vice is an example of an integrated service. Rather than use their own authenti-
cation mechanisms, an authentication service may be called on by other services 
to authenticate users. If users are already authenticated, then the authentication 
service may pass authentication information directly to another service, via an 
API, with no need for users to reauthenticate themselves.2. Independent services 
are services that are simply accessed through a browser 

interface and that operate independently of other services. Information can only 
be shared with other services through explicit user actions such as copy and 

paste; reauthentication may be required for each independent service.If an independent service becomes widely used, the development team may then integrate that service so that it becomes an integrated and supported service.AuthenticationBrowser-based user interface
