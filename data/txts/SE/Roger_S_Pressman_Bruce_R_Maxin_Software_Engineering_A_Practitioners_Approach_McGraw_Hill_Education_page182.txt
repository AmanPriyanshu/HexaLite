152 PART TWO  
MODELING 
 
 
 
Scenario :   
 
1.  Homeowner: observes control panel    
 
2.  Homeowner: enters password    
 
3.  Homeowner: selects “stay” or “away”    
 
4.  Homeowner: observes read alarm light to indicate that  SafeHome 
 has been armed 
   
 
 
Exceptions:    
 
1.  Control panel is  not ready:
 
 homeowner checks all sensors to determine which are open; closes them.    
 
2.  Password is incorrect (control panel beeps once): homeowner reenters correct password.    
 
3.  Password not recognized: monitoring and response subsystem must be contacted to reprogram password.    
 
4.   
Stay 
 is selected: control panel beeps twice and a 
 stay
 
 light is lit; perimeter sensors 
are activated.    
 
5.   
Away
 
 is selected: control panel beeps three times and an  
away 
 light is lit; all 
 sensors are activated.    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Priority: 
 Essential, must be implemented 
   
 
 
 
 
 
When available: 
 First increment 
   
 
 
 
 
 
Frequency of use: 
 Many times per day 
   
 
 
 
 
 
Channel to actor: 
 Via control panel interface 
   
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary actors: 
 Support technician, sensors 
   
 
 
Channels to secondary actors:    
 
 
 
 
 Support technician: phone line 
   
 
 
 
 
 Sensors: hardwired and radio frequency interfaces 
   
 
 
 
Open issues:   
 
1.  Should there be a way to activate the system without the use of a password or with an abbreviated password?    
 
2.  Should the control panel display additional text messages?    
 
3.  How much time does the homeowner have to enter the password from the time the ﬁ rst key is pressed? 
   
 
4.  Is there a way to deactivate the system before it actually activates?   
 
Use cases for other  homeowner 
 interactions would be developed in a similar 
manner. It is important to review each use case with care. If some element of the 

interaction is ambiguous, it is likely that a review of the use case will indicate a 
problem.
