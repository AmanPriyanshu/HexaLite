 CHAPTER 1  
THE NATURE OF SOFTWARE
 
 
 
 
It is important to recognize that there is a subtle distinction between mobile 
web applications and mobile apps. A  
mobile web application
 
 (WebApp) allows a 
mobile device to gain access to web-based content via a browser that has been 
speciﬁ
 cally designed to accommodate the strengths and weaknesses of the mo-
bile platform. A  
mobile app
 
 can gain direct access to the hardware characteris-
tics of the device (e.g., accelerometer or GPS location) and then provide the local 
processing and storage capabilities noted earlier. As time passes, the distinction 
between mobile WebApps and mobile apps will blur as mobile browsers become 
more sophisticated and gain access to device level hardware and information. 
 
 
 
1.2.3  Cloud Computing 
 
 
Cloud computing
 
 encompasses an infrastructure or “ecosystem” that enables 
any user, anywhere, to use a computing device to share computing resources on 
a broad scale. The overall logical architecture of cloud computing is represented 
in
