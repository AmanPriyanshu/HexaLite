CHAPTER 19  
QUALITY CONCEPTS 423 
In an indictment of software developers who refuse to consider external fail-ure costs, Cem Kaner [Kan95] states:  
 
Many of the external failure costs, such as goodwill, are difﬁ cult to quantify, and 
many companies therefore ignore them when calculating their cost-beneﬁ t tradeoffs. 
Other external failure costs can be reduced (e.g. by providing cheaper, lower-quality, 

post-sale support, or by charging customers for support) without increasing customer 
satisfaction. By ignoring the costs to our customers of bad products, quality engineers 
encourage quality-related decision-making that victimizes our customers, rather 
than delighting them.  
  
As expected, the relative costs to ﬁ nd and repair an error or defect increase 
dramatically as we go from prevention to detection to internal failure to external 
failure costs.  Figure 19.2 , based on data collected by Boehm and Basili [Boe01b] and illustrated by Cigital Inc. [Cig07], illustrates this phenomenon.   The industry average cost to correct a defect during code generation is  approximately $977 per error. The industry average cost to correct the same error 
if it is discovered during system testing is $7,136 per error. Cigital Inc. [Cig07] 
considers a large application that has 200 errors introduced during coding.   
According to industry average data, the cost of ﬁ nding and correcting defects during 
the coding phase is $977 per defect. Thus, the total cost for correcting the 200 “criti-
cal” defects during this phase (200 3 $977) is approximately $195,400.  Industry average data shows that the cost of ﬁ nding and correcting defects during 
the system testing phase is $7,136 per defect. In this case, assuming that the sys-
tem testing phase revealed approximately 50 critical defects (or only 25% of those 
found by Cigital in the coding phase), the cost of ﬁ nding and ﬁ
 xing those defects 
3$7,136) would have been approximately $356,800. This would also have resulted
