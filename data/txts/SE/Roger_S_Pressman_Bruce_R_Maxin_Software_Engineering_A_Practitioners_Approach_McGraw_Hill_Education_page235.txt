 205specifying the event that causes the transition to occur, you can specify a guard 
and an action [Cha93]. A  guard
 
 is a Boolean condition that must be satisﬁ
 ed in 
order for the transition to occur. For example, the guard for the transition from 

the “reading” state to the “comparing” state in  Figure 11.1  can be determined by 
examining the use case: if (password input 5 4 digits) then 
  compare 
 
 to stored password 
  
In general, the guard for a transition usually depends upon the value of one or more attributes of an object. In other words, the guard depends on the passive 
state of the object.  An  action 
 occurs concurrently with the state transition or as a consequence of 
it and generally involves one or more operations (responsibilities) of the object. 
For example, the action connected to the  password entered
 
 event ( 
Figure 11.1 ) is an operation named  validatePassword()
 
 that accesses a  
password 
 object and 
performs a digit-by-digit comparison to validate the entered password.  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Sequence Diagrams.   The second type of behavioral representation, called a   
sequence diagram 
 in UML, indicates how events cause transitions from object to object. Once events have been identiﬁ ed by examining a use case, the modeler 
creates a sequence diagram—a representation of how events cause ﬂ ow from 
one object to another as a function of time. In essence, the sequence diagram is    Unlike a state diagram 
that represents 
behavior without 
noting the classes 
involved, a sequence 
diagram represents 
behavior, by describing 

how classes move 
from state to state. ReadingLockedSelectingPasswordentered ComparingPassword = incorrect& numberOfTries < maxTries
