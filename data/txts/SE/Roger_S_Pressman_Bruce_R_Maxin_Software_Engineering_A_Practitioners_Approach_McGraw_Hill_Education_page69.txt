CHAPTER 3  
SOFTWARE PROCESS STRUCTURE

3.2.  Discuss the differences among the various process ﬂ ows described in Section 3.1. 
Can you identify types of problems that might be applicable to each of the generic ﬂ ows 
described?    
 
3.3.  Try to develop a set of actions for the communication activity. Select one action and 
deﬁ ne a task set for it. 
   
 
3.4.  A common problem during  communication 
 
 
 occurs when you encounter two stakehold-ers who have conﬂ icting ideas about what the software should be. That is, you have mutually 
conﬂ icting requirements 
.  Develop a process pattern (this would be a stage pattern) using 
the template presented in Section 3.4 that addresses this problem and suggest an effective 
approach to it.

 READINGS AND INFORMATION
 SOURCES  
 
Most software engineering textbooks consider process models in some detail. Books by Sommerville ( Software Engineering,
 
 9th ed., Addison-Wesley, 2010), Schach ( 
Object-Oriented and Classical Software Engineering,
 
 8th ed., McGraw-Hill, 2010) and Pﬂ
 eeger and 
Atlee ( Software Engineering: Theory and Practice,
 
 4th ed., Prentice Hall, 2009) consider 
traditional paradigms and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. Munch and his col-
leagues ( Software Process Deﬁ
 nition and Management,
 
 Springer, 2012) present a software 
and systems engineering view of the process and the product. Glass ( Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering,
 
 Prentice Hall, 2002) provides an unvarnished, pragmatic view of the 
software engineering process. Although not speciﬁ cally dedicated to process, Brooks ( 
The Mythical Man-Month, 
 2nd ed., Addison-Wesley, 1995) presents age-old project wisdom that 
has everything to do with process.   
 
Firesmith and Henderson-Sellers ( The OPEN Process Framework: An Introduction,
 
  Addison-Wesley, 2001) present a general template for creating “ﬂ
 exible, yet discipline 
software processes” and discuss process attributes and objectives. Madachy ( Software 
Process Dynamics,
 
 Wiley-IEEE, 2008) discusses modeling techniques that allow the inter-
related technical and social elements of the software process to be analyzed. Sharpe and 

McDermott ( Workﬂ
 ow Modeling: Tools for Process Improvement and Application Develop-
ment, 
 2nd ed., Artech House, 2008) present tools for modeling both software and business 
processes. 
  
 
A wide variety of information sources on software engineering and the software pro-cess are available on the Internet. An up-to-date list of World Wide Web references that 

are relevant to the software process can be found at the SEPA website:
