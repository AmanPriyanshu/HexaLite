˜Evidence: A static analysis report for the insulin pump control program. The static 
analysis of the control software revealed no anomalies that affected the value of 
currentDose, the program variable that holds the dose of insulin to be delivered.Argument: The evidence presented demonstrates that the maximum dose of insu-lin that can be computed is equal to maxDose.It is therefore reasonable to assume, with a high level of confidence, that the evi-dence justifies the claim that the insulin pump will not compute a dose of insulin 
to be delivered that exceeds the maximum single safe dose.The evidence presented is both redundant and diverse. The software is checked using 
several different mechanisms with significant overlap between them. As I discussed 
in Chapter 10, using redundant and diverse processes increases confidence. If omis-
sions and mistakes are not detected by one validation process, there is a good chance 
that they will be found by one of the other processes.There will normally be many claims about the safety of a system, with the validity of 
one claim often depending on whether or not other claims are valid. Therefore, claims may 

be organized in a hierarchy. Figure 12.12 shows part of this claim hierarchy for the insulin 

pump. To demonstrate that a high-level claim is valid, you first have to work through the 

arguments for lower-level claims. If you can show that each of these lower-level claims is 

justified, then you may be able to infer that the higher-level claims are justified.ˇˇA general assumption that underlies work in system safety is that the number of sys
-
tem faults that can lead to safety hazards is significantly less than the total number of 
faults that may exist in the system. Safety assurance can therefore concentrate on
