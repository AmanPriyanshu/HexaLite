  Collaborations are discussed in Chapter 27; class diagrams are discussed in Chapter 8; interaction diagrams are discussed in Chapter 18. To complete your model of a design pattern, you must specify its structural, as well as its behavioral, parts, which represent the inside of the collaboration. For example, Figure 28-5 shows a class diagram that represents the structure of this design pattern. Notice how this diagram uses classes that are named as parameters to the pattern. Figure 28-6 shows a sequence diagram that represents the behavior of this design pattern. Figure 28-6 Modeling the Behavioral Aspect of a Design Pattern  Modeling Architectural Patterns The other thing for which you'll use patterns is to model architectural patterns. When you model such a framework, you are, in effect, modeling the infrastructure of an entire architecture that you plan to reuse and adapt to some context. Packages are discussed in Chapter 12. A framework is rendered as a stereotyped package. As a package, a framework provides a set of elements, including#but certainly not limited to#classes, interfaces, use cases, components,
