˜ an operating system platform, such as Linux or Windows;˜ other generic applications that run on that system, such as web browsers and 
email clients;˜ a database management system;˜ middleware that supports distributed computing and database access; and˜ libraries of reusable components that are used by the application software.Network systems are software controlled, and networks may be subject to  security threats where an attacker intercepts and reads or changes network packets. However, this requires specialized equipment, so the majority of security attacks are on the 

software infrastructure of systems. Attackers focus on software infrastructures 

because infrastructure components, such as web browsers, are universally available. 
Attackers can probe these systems for weaknesses and share information about 
 vulnerabilities that they have discovered. As many people use the same software, 

attacks have wide applicability.Infrastructure security is primarily a system management problem, where system 
managers configure the infrastructure to resist attacks. System security management 

includes a range of activities such as user and permission management, system 
 software deployment and maintenance, and attack monitoring, detection, and 
 recovery:1. User and permission management involves adding and removing users from the 
system, ensuring that appropriate user authentication mechanisms are in place, 
and setting up the permissions in the system so that users only have access to the 

resources they need.2.
 System software deployment and maintenance involves installing system  software 
and middleware and configuring these properly so that security  vulnerabilities are 
avoided. It also involves updating this software regularly with new versions or 

patches, which repair security problems that have been discovered.Operating System
