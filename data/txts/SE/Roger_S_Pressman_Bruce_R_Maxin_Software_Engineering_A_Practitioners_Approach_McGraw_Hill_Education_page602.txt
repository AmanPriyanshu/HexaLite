QUALITY MANAGEMENT
instead of emulators reduces the incidence of false defect reporting and en-
sures that user-level errors will be more likely to be uncovered (Section 26.2.5). 
 
 
Rapid defect resolution.
 
 Speeds implementation through automatic submis-
sion of defect information and generation of discrepancy reports allowing de-
velopers to reduce the time required to resolve defects. 
 
 
Reuse of test scripts.
 
 Provides cost savings by eliminating the need to start 
test case creation from scratch when enhancements are made. It is important 
for the test tool architecture to allow the separation of function interfaces and 
test logic. This allows interfaces to be wrapped in reusable functions as tools

Building a Test Matrix 
 
MobileApps are often developed for multiple devices and designed to be 
used in many different contexts and locations. A  
weighted device platform 
matrix
 
 (WDPM) helps ensure that test coverage includes each combination 
of mobile device and context variables.

 The WDPM can also be used to help 
prioritize the device/context combinations so that the most important are 
tested first. 
 
The steps to build the WDPM ( 
Figure 26.1 
) for several devices and operating 
systems are: (1) list the important operating system variants as the matrix col-
umn labels, (2) list the targeted devices as the matrix row labels, (3) assign a 
ranking (e.g., 0 to 10) to indicate the relative importance of each operating sys-
tem and each device, and (4) compute the product of each pair of rankings and 
enter each product as the cell entry in the matrix (use NA for combinations that 
are not available). 
 
 
Testing effort should be adjusted so that the device/platform combinations 
with the highest ratings receive the most attention for each context variable 
under consideration. In  
Figure 26.1 
,  
Device4
 
 and  
OS3
 
 have the highest rating and 
would receive high-priority attention during testing.

Context variables
 
 are variables that are associated with either the current connection or the 
current transaction that the MobileApp will use to direct its visible-user behavior.
