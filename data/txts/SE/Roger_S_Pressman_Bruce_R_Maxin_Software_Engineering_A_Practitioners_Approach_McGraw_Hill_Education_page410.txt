380 PART TWO  
MODELING 
Photograph 
 (a .jpg image) has the attributes 
horizontal dimension, vertical dimension, and border style.  UML association and an aggregation  6 
 
 may be used to represent relationships 
between content objects. For example, the UML association shown in  Figure 17.3  indicates that one  CompDescription 
 is used for each instance of the  
ProductCom-ponent 
 class.  
CompDescription 
 is composed on the ﬁ
 ve content objects shown. 
However, the multiplicity notation shown indicates that  
Schematic 
 and 
 Video
 
 are 
optional (0 occurrences are possible), one  MarketingDescription 
 and one  
Tech-
Description 
 are required, and one or more instances of  Photograph 
 are used.   
 
 
17.6.2  Content Design Issues 
 
Once all content objects are modeled, the information that each object is to deliver 
must be authored and then formatted to best meet the customer’s needs. Content 

authoring is the job of specialists in the relevant area who design the content ob-
ject by providing an outline of information to be delivered and an indication of 

the types of generic content objects (e.g., descriptive text, graphic images, photo-
graphs) that will be used to deliver the information. Aesthetic design (Section 17.5) 

may also be applied to represent the proper look and feel for the content.
