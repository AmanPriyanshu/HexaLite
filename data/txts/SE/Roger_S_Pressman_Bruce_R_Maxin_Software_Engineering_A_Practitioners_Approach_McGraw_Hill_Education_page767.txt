CHAPTER 33  
ESTIMATION FOR SOFTWARE PROJECTS
 737“characteristics of good human/machine interface design” means or what the size and sophistication of the “CAD database” are to be.  For our purposes, assume that further reﬁ nement has occurred and that the 
major software functions listed in   
Figure 33.2  
 are identiﬁ
 ed. Following the de-
composition technique for LOC, an estimation table (  
Figure 33.2  
) is developed. A range of LOC estimates is developed for each function. For example, the range 
of LOC estimates for the 3D geometric analysis function is optimistic, 4600 LOC; 
most likely, 6900 LOC; and pessimistic, 8600 LOC. Applying Equation (33.1), the 

expected value for the 3D geometric analysis function is 6800 LOC. Other esti-
mates are derived in a similar fashion. By summing vertically in the estimated 
LOC column, an estimate of 33,200 lines of code is established for the CAD system.  
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
A review of historical data indicates that the organizational average produc-tivity for systems of this type is 620 LOC/pm. Based on a burdened labor rate of 
$8,000 per month, the cost per line of code is approximately $13. Based on the 
LOC estimate and the historical productivity data, the total estimated project 
cost is $431,000 and the estimated effort is 54 person-months.  7 
 
 
 
 
    Do not succumb to 
the temptation to use 
this result as your 
project estimate. You 

should derive another 
result using a different 
approach.   
7  Estimates are rounded to the nearest $1,000 and person-month. Further precision is unneces-
sary and unrealistic, given the limitations of estimation accuracy.

The conversation:    
Doug:  We need to develop an effort estimate for the 
project and then we’ve got to deﬁ ne a micro schedule 
for the ﬁ rst increment and a macro schedule for the 
remaining increments.  SAFEHOME pre22126_ch33_727-753.indd   737pre22126_ch33_727-753.indd   73713/12/13   6:17 PM13/12/13   6:17 PM
