 Packages are discussed in Chapter 12. As your models get bigger, you will find that many source code files tend to cluster together in groups that are conceptually and semantically related. Most of the time, your development tools will place these groups in separate directories. In the UML, you can use packages to model these clusters of source code files. Trace relationships, a kind of dependency, are discussed in Chapters 5 and 10. In the UML, it is possible to visualize the relationship of a class to its source code file and, in turn, the relationship of a source code file to its executable or library by using trace relationships. However, you'll rarely need to go to this detail of modeling. Hints and Tips When you model components in the UML, remember that you are modeling in the physical dimension. A well-structured component 路 Provides a crisp abstraction of something drawn from the physical aspect of the system. 路 Provides the realization of a small, well-defined set of interfaces. 路 Directly implements a set of classes that work together to carry out the semantics of these interfaces with economy and elegance. 路 Is loosely coupled relative to other components; most often, you'll model components only in connection with dependency and realization relationships. When you draw a component in the UML,
