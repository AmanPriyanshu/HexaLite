Trading systems may be developed for any type of marketplace, with the informa-tion exchanged being information about the goods being traded and their prices. 
Although trading systems are systems in their own right and could conceivably be 

used for individual trading, they are most useful in an automated trading context 

where the systems negotiate directly with each other.The major problem with this type of system is that there is no governance mecha-nism, so any of the systems involved may change at any time. Because these changes 
may contradict the assumptions made by other systems, trading cannot continue. 

Sometimes the owners of the systems in the coalition wish to be able to continue 

trading with other systems and so may make informal arrangements to ensure that 
changes to one system do not make trading impossible. In other cases, such as a 

travel aggregator, an airline may deliberately change its system so that it is unavail-
able and so force bookings to be made directly with it.Trading
