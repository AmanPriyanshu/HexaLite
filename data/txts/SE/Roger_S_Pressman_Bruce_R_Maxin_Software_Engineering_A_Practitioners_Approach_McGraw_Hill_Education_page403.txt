WEBAPP DESIGN 373and then store sensitive customer information. For these and many 
other reasons, WebApp security is paramount in many situations. The 

key measure of security is the ability of the WebApp and its server en-

vironment to rebuff unauthorized access and/or thwart an outright 

malevolent attack. Security engineering is discussed in Chapter 27.

Availability. 
  Even the best WebApp will not meet users’ needs if it is un-
available. In a technical sense, availability is the measure of the percent-
age of time that a WebApp is available for use. But Offutt [Off02] suggests 

that “using features available on only one browser or one platform” makes 
the WebApp unavailable to those with a different browser/platform conﬁ
 g-
uration. The user will invariably go elsewhere.    
 
 
 
 
 
Scalability. 
  Can the WebApp and its server environment be scaled 
to handle 100, 1,000, 10,000, or 100,000 users? Will the WebApp and 

the systems with which it is interfaced handle signiﬁ cant variation in 
volume or will responsiveness drop dramatically (or cease altogether)? 

It is important to design a WebApp that can accommodate the burden 

of success (i.e., signiﬁ cantly more end users) and become even more 
successful. 
   
 
 
 
 
 
Time-to-Market. 
  Although time-to-market is not a true quality attribute 
in the technical sense, it is a measure of quality from a business point of 
view. The ﬁ
 rst WebApp to address a speciﬁ
 c market segment often cap-
tures a disproportionate number of end users.  Web
