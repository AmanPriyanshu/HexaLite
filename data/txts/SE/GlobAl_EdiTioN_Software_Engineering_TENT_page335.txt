different impressions of reliability because they use a system in different ways. It is difficult to match all of these patterns of use in a single operational profile.2. Users change the ways that they use a system over time. As users learn about 

a new system and become more confident with it, they start to use it in more 

sophisticated ways. Therefore, an operational profile that matches the initial 

usage pattern of a system may not be valid after users become familiar with 

the system.For these reasons, it is often impossible to develop a trustworthy operational pro-file. If you use an out-of-date or incorrect operational profile, you cannot be confi-
dent about the accuracy of any reliability measurements that you make.˜˝
