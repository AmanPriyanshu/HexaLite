Figure 4.3 Types of non-functional requirements2. An individual non-functional requirement, such as a security requirement, may 
generate several, related functional requirements that define new system ser-
vices that are required if the non-functional requirement is to be implemented. 
In addition, it may also generate requirements that constrain existing require
-ments; for example, it may limit access to information in the system.Nonfunctional requirements arise through user needs because of budget con-straints, organizational policies, the need for interoperability with other software or 
hardware systems, or external factors such as safety regulations or privacy legisla-
tion. Figure 4.3 is a classification of non-functional requirements. You can see from 
this diagram that the non-functional requirements may come from required charac-
teristics of the software (product requirements), the organization developing the 

software (organizational requirements), or external sources:1. Product requirements These requirements specify or constrain the runtime 
behavior of the software. Examples include performance requirements for how 
fast the system must execute and how much memory it requires; reliability 

requirements that set out the acceptable failure rate; security requirements; and 
usability requirements.2. Organizational requirements 
These requirements are broad system require
-ments derived from policies and procedures in the customer™s and developer™s 
organizations. Examples include operational process requirements that define 

how the system will be used; development process requirements that specify the
