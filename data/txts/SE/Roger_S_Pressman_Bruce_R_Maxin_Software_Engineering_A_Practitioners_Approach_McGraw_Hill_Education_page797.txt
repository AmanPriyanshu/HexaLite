CHAPTER 34  
PROJECT SCHEDULING 767tables 
—a tabular listing of all project tasks, their planned and actual start and end dates, and a variety of related information (  
Figure 34.4  
). Used in conjunction with the time-line chart, project tables enable you to track progress.  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
34.5.2   
Tracking the Schedule 
 
 
If it has been properly developed, the project schedule becomes a road map that deﬁ nes the tasks and milestones to be tracked and controlled as the project pro-
ceeds. Tracking can be accomplished in a number of different ways:
  
 
 
•  Conducting periodic project status meetings in which each team member reports progress and problems.   
 
 
•  Evaluating the results of all reviews conducted throughout the software engineering process.   
 
 
•  Determining whether formal project milestones (the diamonds shown in   
Figure 34.3  
) have been accomplished by the scheduled date.   
 
 
•  Comparing the actual start date to the planned start date for each project task listed in the resource table (  
Figure 34.4  
).   
 
 
•  Meeting informally with practitioners to obtain their subjective assess-ment of progress to date and problems on the horizon.   
 
 
•  Using earned value analysis (Section 34.6) to assess progress quantitatively. 
   
 
In reality, all of these tracking techniques are used by experienced project 
managers.

software status 
reporting can be 
summarized in a 
single phrase: ‘No 
surprises’.“  Capers Jones
