Microsoft ( Performance Testing Guidance for Web Applications,
 
 Microsoft Press, 2008) 
and Subraya  (Integrated Approach to Web Performance Testing,
 
 IRM Press, 2006) present 
detailed treatments of performance testing for WebApps. Hope and Walther ( 
Web Security 
Testing Cookbook,
 
 O’Reilly, 2008), Skoudis ( 
Counter Hack Reloaded, 
 Prentice Hall, 2nd ed, 
2006), Andreu ( Profession Pen Testing for Wes Applications,
 
Wrox, 2006), Chirillo ( 
Hack Attacks Revealed, 
 2nd ed., Wiley, 2003), Splaine ( 
Testing Web Security,
 
Wiley, 2002), and Klevinsky 
and his colleagues ( Hack I.T.: Security through Penetration Testing,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 2002) 
provide much useful information for those who must design security tests. In addition, 
books that address security testing for software in general can provide important guid-
ance for those who must test WebApps. Representative titles include: Engebretson ( 
Basics of Hacking and Penetration Testing,
 
 Syngress, 2011), Basta and Halton ( 
Computer Security and Penetration Testing,
 
 Thomson Delmar Learning, 2007), Wysopal and his colleagues ( 
The Art of Software Security Testing,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 2006), and Gallagher and his colleagues 
( Hunting Security Bugs, 
 Microsoft Press, 2006).   
 
A wide variety of information sources on WebApp testing is available on the Internet. 
An up-to-date list of World Wide Web references can be found under “software engineering 

resources” at the SEPA website:
