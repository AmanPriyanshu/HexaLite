196 PART TWO  
MODELING 
In all cases, the collaborator class name is recorded on the CRC model index card next to the responsibility that has spawned the collaboration. Therefore, 
the index card contains a list of responsibilities and the corresponding collabo-
rations that enable the responsibilities to be fulﬁ lled ( 
Figure 10.3 ).  When a complete CRC model has been developed, the representatives from the stakeholders can review the model using the following approach [Amb95]:  
 
 
 1.
  All participants in the review (of the CRC model) are given a subset of the CRC model index cards. Cards that collaborate should be separated (i.e., 
no reviewer should have two cards that collaborate).   
 
 
 2.
  All use-case scenarios (and corresponding use-case diagrams) should be organized into categories.   
 
 
 3.
  The review leader reads the use case deliberately. As the review leader 
comes to a named object, she passes a token to the person holding the 
corresponding class index card. For example, a use case for  SafeHome 
 contains the following narrative:  
 
 
The homeowner observes the  SafeHome 
 control panel to determine if the system 
is ready for input. If the system is not ready, the homeowner must physically close 

 windows/doors so that the ready indicator is present. [A not-ready indicator implies that a sensor is open, i.e., that a door or window is open.]    
 
   When the review leader comes to “control panel,” in the use case narra-
tive, the token is passed to the person. holding the  ControlPanel 
 index card. The phrase “implies that a sensor is open” requires that the index 
card contains a responsibility that will validate this implication (the 
 responsibility  determine-sensor-status()
 
 accomplishes this). Next to the  responsibility on the index card is the collaborator  Sensor.
 
 The token is then passed to the  Sensor 
 object.  PlayerPlayerHeadPlayerBodyPlayerArmsPlayerLegs
