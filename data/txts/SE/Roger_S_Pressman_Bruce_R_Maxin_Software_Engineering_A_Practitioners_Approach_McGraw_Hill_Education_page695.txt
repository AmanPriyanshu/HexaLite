PRODUCT METRICS 665 The arc-to-node ratio,  r 5 a/n,  measures the connectivity density of the architec-ture and may provide a simple indication of the coupling of the architecture. For 
the architecture shown in   Figure 30.4  ,

 The U.S. Air Force Systems Command [USA87] has developed a number of software quality indicators that are based on measurable design characteristics 
of a computer program. Using concepts similar to those proposed in IEEE Std. 
982.1-2005 [IEE05], the Air Force uses information obtained from data and archi-
tectural design to derive a  design structure quality index
  (DSQI) that ranges from 0 to 1. The following values must be ascertained to compute the DSQI [Cha89]: S 1 5  total number of modules deﬁ ned in the program architecture
 S 2 5  number of modules whose correct function depends on the source 
of data input or that produce data to be used elsewhere (in general, 
control modules, among others, would not be counted as part of  S 
2) S 
3 5  number of modules whose correct function depends on prior processing S 
4 5  number of database items (includes data objects and all attributes that 
deﬁ ne objects)
 S 
5 5  total number of unique database items
 S 
6 5  number of database segments (different records or individual objects)
 S 
7 5  number of modules with a single entry and exit (exception processing 
is not considered to be a multiple exit)  
 Once values  S 1 through  S 
7 are determined for a computer program, the following intermediate values can be computed:        
Program structure: D
 
1, where  D 
1 is deﬁ ned as follows: If the architectural de-
sign was developed using a distinct method (e.g., data ﬂ ow–oriented design or 

object-oriented design), then  D 
1 5 1, otherwise  D 
1 5 0.      uote: 
 “Measurement 
can be seen as 
a detour. This 

detour is necessary 

because humans 
mostly are not 
able to make clear 
and objective 
decisions [without 
quantitative 
support].”  Horst Zuse
