ment plans are implemented. You should therefore update this table during each 

iteration of the risk management process.Once the risks have been analyzed and ranked, you should assess which of these risks are most significant. Your judgment must depend on a combination of the prob-
ability of the risk arising and the effects of that risk. In general, catastrophic risks 

should always be considered, as should all serious risks that have more than a moder

ate probability of occurrence.Boehm (Boehm 1988) recommends identifying and monitoring the ﬁtop 10ﬂ risks. However, I think that the right number of risks to monitor must depend on the pro-
ject. It might be 5 or it might be 15. From the risks identified in Figure 22.4, I think 
that it is appropriate to consider the eight risks that have catastrophic or serious con-
sequences (Figure 22.5).
