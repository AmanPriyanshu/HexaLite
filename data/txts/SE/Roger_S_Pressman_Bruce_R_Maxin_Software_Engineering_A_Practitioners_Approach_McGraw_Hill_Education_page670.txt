640 PART THREE  
QUALITY MANAGEMENT 
 
 
The ﬂ ow of information for conﬁ
 guration status reporting (CSR) is illustrated 
in  Figure 29.5  
 
. Each time an SCI is assigned new or updated identiﬁ cation, a CSR 
entry is made. Each time a change is approved by the CCA (i.e., an ECO is is-
sued), a CSR entry is made. Each time a conﬁ guration audit is conducted, the 
results are reported as part of the CSR task. Output from CSR may be placed in 
an online database or website, so that software developers or support staff can 
access change information by keyword category. In addition, a CSR report is gen-

erated on a regular basis and is intended to keep management and practitioners 
appraised of important changes.    Develop a “need to 
know” list for every 

conﬁ guration object 

and keep it up to 
date. When a change 
is made, be sure that 
everyone on the list is 

notiﬁ ed. 
  
 
SCM Support   
 Objective: 
 SCM tools provide support 
to one or more of the process activities discussed in Section 29.3.   Mechanics: 
 Most modern SCM tools work in 
conjunction with a repository (a database system) and 

provide mechanisms for identiﬁ cation, version and 
change control, auditing, and reporting.

CONFIGURATION
 MANAGEMENT FOR WEB AND MOBILEAPPS  
 
Earlier in this book, we discussed the special nature of Web and MobileApps 
and the specialized methods  9 
 
 
 
 that are required to build them. Among the many 
characteristics that differentiate these applications from traditional software is 
the ubiquitous nature of change.  Web and mobile developers often use an iterative, incremental process model 
that applies many principles derived from agile software development (Chap-
