102 PART ONE  
THE SOFTWARE PROCESS
 
 
 
6.10.  Presently, the cloud is one of the more hyped concepts in the world of computing. 
Describe how the cloud can add value for a software engineering organization with speciﬁ c 
reference to services that are speciﬁ cally designed to enhance software engineering work. 
   
 
6.11.  Do some research on one of the CDE tools noted in the sidebar in Section 6.8 (or a tool assigned by your instructor) and prepare a brief presentation of the tool’s capabilities for 

your class.    
 
6.12.  Referring to  Figure 6.2 , why does distance complicate communication? Why does dis-tance accentuate the need for coordination? Why types of barriers and complexity are in-
troduced by distance?

 READINGS AND INFORMATION
 SOURCES  
 
Although many books have addressed the human aspects of software engineering, two books can legitimately be called classics. Jerry Weinberg ( 
The Psychology of Computer Pro-
gramming, 
 Silver Anniversary Edition, Dorset House, 1998) was the ﬁ
 rst to consider the 
psychology of the people who build computer software. Tom DeMarco and Tim Lister ( 
Peo-pleware: Productive Projects and Teams,
 
 2nd ed., Dorset House, 1999) argue that the major 
challenges in software development are human, not technical.   
 
Useful insights into the human aspects of software engineering have also been provided by Mantle and Lichty ( Managing the Unmanageable: Rules, Tools, and Insights for Managing 
Software People and Teams
 
, Addison-Wesley, 2012), Fowler ( 
The Passionate Programmer,
 
 Pragmatic Bookshelf, 2009), McConnell ( Code Complete, 
 2nd ed., Microsoft Press, 2004), 
Brooks ( The Mythical Man-Month, 
 2nd ed., Addison-Wesley, 1999), and Hunt and Thomas 
( The Pragmatic Programmer,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 1999). Tomayko and Hazzan  
(Human Aspects of Software Engineering,
 
 Charles River Media, 2004) address both the psychology and sociol-
ogy of software engineering with an emphasis on XP. 
  
 
The human aspects of the agile development have been addressed by Rasmussen ( The Agile Samurai, 
 Pragmatic Bookshelf, 2010) and Davies ( 
Agile Coaching, 
 Pragmatic Book-
shelf, 2010). Important aspects of agile teams are considered by Adkins ( Coaching Agile Teams,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 2010), and Derby, Larsen, and Schwaber ( 
Agile Retrospectives: Mak-
ing Good Teams Great,
 
 Pragmatic Bookshelf, 2006).   
 
Problem solving is a uniquely human activity and is addressed in books by Adair ( Deci-sion Making and Problem Solving Strategies,
 
 Kogan Page, 2010), Roam ( 
Unfolding the Nap-kin, 
 Portfolio Trade, 2009), and Wananabe ( 
Problem Solving 101,
 
 Portfolio Hardcover, 2009). 
  
 
Guidelines for facilitating collaboration within a software team are presented by Tabaka 
( Collaboration Explained, 
 Addison-Wesley, 2006). Rosen ( 
The Culture of Collaboration,
 
 Red 
Ape Publishing, 2009), Hansen ( Collaboration 
, Harvard Business School Press, 2009), and Sawyer ( Group Genius: The Creative Power of Collaboration,
 
 Basic Books, 2007) present 
strategies and practical guidelines for improving collaboration on technical teams.   
 
Fostering human innovation is the subject of books by Gray, Brown, and Macanufo ( 
Game Storming, 
 O-Reilly Media, 2010), Duggan ( 
Strategic Intuition, 
 Columbia University Press, 
2007), and Hohmann ( Innovation Games, 
 Addison-Wesley, 2006). 
  
 
An overall look at global software development is presented by Ebert  (Global Software 
and IT: A Guide to Distributed Development, Projects, and Outsourcing,
 
 Wiley-IEEE Com-
puter Society Press, 2011). Mite and his colleagues ( Agility Across Time and Space: Imple-
menting Agile Methods in Global Software Projects,
 
 Springer, 2010) have edited an anthology 
that addresses the use of agile teams in global development.   
 
A wide variety of information sources that discuss the human aspects of software engineer-
ing are available on the Internet. An up-to-date list of World Wide Web references that are rel-

evant to the software process can be found at the SEPA website:
