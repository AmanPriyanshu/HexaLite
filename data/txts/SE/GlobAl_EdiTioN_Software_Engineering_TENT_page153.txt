For example, all doctors have a name and phone number, and all hospital doc-tors have a staff number and carry a pager. General practitioners don™t have these 
attributes, as they work independently, but they have an individual practice name 

and address. Figure 5.12 shows part of the generalization hierarchy, which I have 

extended with class attributes, for the class Doctor. The operations associated with 

the class Doctor are intended to register and de-register that doctor with the 

Mentcare system.ˇˇObjects in the real world are often made up of different parts. For example, a study 

pack for a course may be composed of a book, PowerPoint slides, quizzes, and rec
-
ommendations for further reading. Sometimes in a system model, you need to illus-
trate this. The UML provides a special type of association between classes called 

aggregation, which means that one object (the whole) is composed of other objects 
(the parts). To define aggregation, a diamond shape is added to the link next to the 
class that represents the whole.Figure 5.
13 shows that a patient record is an aggregate of Patient and an indefinite 
number of Consultations. That is, the record maintains personal patient information 
as well as an individual record for each consultation with a doctor.DoctorGeneral practitionerHospital doctorName
