CHAPTER 13  
ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN 271 
Continuing the  SafeHome 
 home security function example, you might deﬁ
 ne 
the set of top-level components that address the following functionality:  
 
 
•   
External communication management —coordinates communication of the security function with external entities such as other Internet-based 
systems and external alarm notiﬁ cation. 
  
 
 
•   
Control panel processing
 
—manages all control panel functionality. 
  
 
 
•   
Detector management —coordinates access to all detectors attached to the system.   
 
 
•   
Alarm processing
 
—veriﬁ es and acts on all alarm conditions. 
   
 
Each of these top-level components would have to be elaborated iteratively and then positioned within the overall  SafeHome 
 architecture. Design classes 
(with appropriate attributes and operations) would be deﬁ ned for each. It is im-
portant to note, however, that the design details of all attributes and operations 

would not be speciﬁ ed until component-level design ( 
Chapter 14 ).  The overall architectural structure (represented as a UML component dia-gram) is illustrated in  Figure 13.8 . Transactions are acquired by  
external com-munication management 
 as they move in from components that process the 
 SafeHome 
 GUI and the Internet interface. This information is managed by a 
 SafeHome 
 executive component that selects the appropriate product function 
(in this case security). The  control panel processing
 
 component interacts with 
the homeowner to arm/disarm the security function. The  detector management
