MOBILEAPP DESIGN 395of conﬁ dence in the security and privacy of a MobileApp often reduce the 
usability of the app and the spontaneity of the communication among users 

[Rot02].  
  
Computational and storage limitations. 
  There is great interest in using 
mobile devices to control home environmental and security services. When 
MobileApps are allowed to interact with devices and services in their en-
vironment, it is easy to overwhelm the mobile device (storage, processing 
speed, power consumed) with the sheer volume of information [Spa11]. 
Developers may need to look for programming shortcuts and means of 
 reducing the demands made on processor and memory resources.   
Applications that depend on external services. 
  Building thin 
  mobile  clients suggests the need to rely on Web service providers and cloud stor-
age facilities. This increases concerns for both data or service accessibility 
and security [Rot02].   
Testing complexity.
 
  Thin-client MobileApps are particularly challeng-
ing to test.  12 
 
 They exhibit many of the same testing challenges found in  WebApps (Chapter 25), but they have the additional concerns associated 
with transmission of data through Internet gateways and telephone net-
works [Was10]. Testing of MobileApps will be discussed in Chapter 26.

DEVELOPING MOBILEAPPS  
 
Andreu [And05] describes a spiral engineering process model for MobileApp de-sign containing six activities:   
 
 
Formulation. 
 Involves architectural design, navigation design, the goals, fea-tures, and functions of the MobileApp are identiﬁ ed to determine the scope and 
the size of the ﬁ rst increment. Developers must be conscious of human, social, 
cultural, and organizational activities that may reveal hidden aspects of the 
users’ needs and affect the business targets and functionality of the proposed 
MobileApp.   
Planning. 
 The total project costs and risks are determined. The detailed schedule is set and the process for the next increments is documented.   
Analysis. 
 All mobile user requirements are speciﬁ ed and the content items 
that will be needed are identiﬁ ed. Actions include content analysis, interaction 
analysis, functional analysis, and conﬁ guration analysis. It is at this stage that 
developers identify whether they will build a thin or fat client. Identifying the 
nature of the user goals (informational or transactional) will help to determine 
the type of MobileApp that needs to be developed.    WebApp development 
makes use of an agile, 
spiral engineering 
process model.   
12  MobileApps that run entirely on the device can be tested using traditional software testing 
methods (Chapter 23) or using emulators running on personal computers. pre22126_ch18_391-410.indd   395pre22126_ch18_391-410.indd   39516/12/13   6:23 PM16/12/13   6:23 PM
