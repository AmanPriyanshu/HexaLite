340 PART TWO  
MODELING 
 
 
 
 
 
Nielsen and Wagner [Nie96] suggest a few pragmatic “don’ts” for interface 
 design (based on their redesign of a major WebApp). These provide a nice com-
plement to the principles suggested earlier in this section.   
 
 
 
•  Don’t force the user to read voluminous amounts of text, particularly when the text explains the operation of the WebApp or assists in navigation. 
  
 
 
•  Don’t make users scroll unless it is absolutely unavoidable.   
 
 
•  Don’t rely on browser functions to assist in navigation.   
 
 
•  Don’t allow aesthetics to supersede functionality.

The scene:  Doug Miller’s ofﬁ
 ce. 
   
 
 
 
 
 
The players:  Doug Miller (manager of the  
SafeHome 
 software engineering group) and Vinod Raman, a 
member of the  SafeHome 
 product software engineering team.    
 
 
 
 
 
The conversation:  
   
 
 
 
 
 
Doug:  Vinod, have you and the team had a chance 
to review the   
SafeHomeAssured.com 
 
 e-commerce interface prototype? 
   
 
 
 
 
 
Vinod:  Y
technical point of view, and I have a bunch of notes.

team for the outsourcing vendor for the  SafeHome  e-commerce website] yesterday. 
   
 
 
 
 
 
Doug:  You and Sharon can get together and discuss 
y of the important 

issues.    
 
 
 
 
 
Vinod:  Overall, they’ve done a good job, nothing 
ground breaking, but it’s a typical e-commerce inter-

face, decent aesthetics, reasonable layout, they’ve hit 
all the impor
   
 
 
 
 
 
Doug (smiling ruefully):  But? 
   
 
 
 
 
 
Vinod:  W
   
 
 
 
 
 
Doug:  Such 
   
 
 
 
 
 
Vinod (showing Doug a sequence of story-boards for the interface prototype):  Here’s the 
major functions menu that’s displayed on the home 

page:   
 
 
 
 
Learn about   SafeHome. 
 
   
 
 
 
Describe your home.  
   
 
 
 
Get   SafeHome 
 
 component recommendations. 
 
   
 
 
 
Purchase a   SafeHome 
 
 system.  
   
 
 
 
Get technical support.  
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
The problem isn’t with these functions. They’re all okay, 
but the level of abstraction isn’t right. 
   
 
 
 
 
 
Doug:  They’re all major functions, aren’t they? 
   
 
 
 
 
 
Vinod:  They are, but here’-

real need to describe the house if you don’t want to. I’d 

suggest only four menu options on the home page:   
 
 
 
 
Learn about   
SafeHome. 
 
    
 
 
Specify the   SafeHome 
 
 system you need.  
   
 
 
 
Purchase a   SafeHome 
 
 system.  
   
 
 
 
Get technical support.  
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
When you select  Specify the 
  SafeHome 
 
 system you need 
, you’ll then have the following options:   
 
 
 
 
Select   SafeHome 
 
 components.  
   
 
 
 
Get   SafeHome 
 
 component recommendations. 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
If you’re a knowledgeable user, you’ll select compo-
nents from a set of categorized pull-down menus for 
sensors, cameras, control panels, and more. If you need 
help, you’ll ask for a recommendation and that will 
require that you describe your house. I think it’s a bit 

more logical.    
 
 
 
 
 
Doug:  I agree. Have you talked with Sharon about 
this?    
 
 
 
 
 
Vinod:  No, I want to discuss this with marketing ﬁ
 rst; 
then I’ll give her a call.
