only the use of a signal. Signals that are asynchronous operations are listed in the normal operation compartment of the class. Common Modeling Techniques Modeling a Family of Signals Generalization is discussed in Chapters 5 and 10. In most event-driven systems, signal events are hierarchical. For example, an autonomous robot might distinguish between external signals, such as a Collision, and internal ones, such as a HardwareFault. External and internal signals need not be disjoint, however. Even within these two broad classifications, you might find specializations. For example, HardwareFault signals might be further specialized as BatteryFault and MovementFault. Even these might be further specialized, such as MotorStall, a kind of MovementFault. State machines are discussed in Chapter 21. By modeling hierarchies of signals in this manner, you can specify polymorphic events. For example, consider a state machine with a transition triggered only by the receipt of a MotorStall. As a leaf signal in this hierarchy, the transition can be triggered only by that signal, so it is not polymorphic. In contrast, suppose you modeled the state machine with a transition triggered by the receipt of a HardwareFault. In this case, the transition is polymorphic and can be triggered by a HardwareFault or any of its specializations, including BatteryFault, MovementFault, and MotorStall. To model a family of signals, · Consider all the different kinds of signals to which a given set of active objects may respond. · Look for the common kinds of signals and place them in a generalization/specialization hierarchy using inheritance. Elevate more general ones and lower more specialized ones. · Look for the opportunity for polymorphism in the state machines of these active objects. Where you find polymorphism, adjust the hierarchy as necessary by introducing intermediate abstract signals. Abstract classes are discussed in Chapter 5. Figure 20-6 models a family of signals that may be handled by an autonomous robot. Note that the root signal (RobotSignal) is abstract, which means that there may be no direct instances. This signal has two immediate concrete specializations (Collision and HardwareFault), one of which (HardwareFault) is further specialized. Note that the Collision signal has one parameter.
