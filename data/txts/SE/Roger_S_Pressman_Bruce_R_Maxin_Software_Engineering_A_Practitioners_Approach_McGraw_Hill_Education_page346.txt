 Addison-Wesley, 2000) discussed CBSE with a UML emphasis. 
  
 
Malik ( Component-Based Software Development,

ents methods for building effective component repositories. Gross ( Component-Based Soft-ware Testing with UML,
 
 Springer, 2010) and Gao and his colleagues ( 
Testing and Quality 
Assurance for Component-Based Software,
 
 Artech House, 2006) discuss testing and SQA 
issues for component-based systems.    
 
Dozens of books describing the industry’s component-based standards have been pub-
lished in recent years. These address the inner workings of the standards themselves but 
also consider many important CBSE topics.    
 
The work of Linger, Mills, and Witt ( 
Structured Programming—Theory and Practice,
 
  Addison-Wesley, 1979) remains a deﬁ
 nitive treatment of the subject. The text contains a 
good PDL as well as detailed discussions of the ramiﬁ cations of structured programming. 
Other books that focus on procedural design issues for traditional systems include those 
by Farrell ( A Guide to Programming Logic and Design,
 
 Course Technology, 2010), Robertson 
( Simple Program Design,
 
 5th ed., Course Technology, 2006), Bentley ( 
Programming Pearls,
 
 2nd ed., Addison-Wesley, 1999), and Dahl ( 
Structured Programming,
 
 Academic Press, 1997).    
 
Relatively few recent books have been dedicated solely to component-level design. In general, programming language books address procedural design in some detail but al-
ways in the context of the language that is introduced by the book. Hundreds of titles are 
available.    
 
A wide variety of information sources on component-level design are available on the Internet. An up-to-date list of World Wide Web references that are relevant to compo-

nent-level design can be found at the SEPA website:
