Figure 6.9 The architecture of the iLearn systemFigure 6.
9 shows that the iLearn digital learning system, introduced in Chapter 1, 
has a four-layer architecture that follows this pattern. You can see another example 
of the Layered Architecture pattern in Figure 6.19 (Section 6.4, which shows the 

organization of the Mentcare system.The layered architecture and MVC patterns are examples of patterns where the view 

presented is the conceptual organization of a system. My next example, the Repository 

pattern (Figure 6.10), describes how a set of interacting components can share data.NameRepositoryDescriptionAll data in a system is managed in a central repository that is accessible to all system 
components. Components do not interact directly, only through the repository.ExampleFigure 6.
11 is an example of an IDE where the components use a repository of system design 

infor mation. Each software tool generates information, which is then available for use by other tools.When usedYou should use this pattern when you have a system in which large volumes of information are 

generated that has to be stored for a long time. You may also use it in data-driven systems where 

the inclusion of data in the repository triggers an action or tool.AdvantagesComponents can be independent; they do not need to know of the existence of other 

components. Changes made by one component can be propagated to all components. All data 

can be managed consistently (e.g., backups done at the same time) as it is all in one place.DisadvantagesThe repository is a single point of failure so problems in the repository affect the whole 
system. May be inefficiencies in organizing all communication through the repository. 
Distributing the repository across several computers may be difficult.Figure 6.10 The Repository pattern
