For a small software project requested by one person (at a remote location) with simple, straightforward requirements, the  communication 
 activity might 
encompass little more than a phone call or email with the appropriate stake-
holder. Therefore, the only necessary action is  
phone conversation, 
 and the work 
tasks (the  task set 
) that this action encompasses are:  
 
 
 1.  Make contact with stakeholder via telephone.    
 
 2.  Discuss requirements and develop notes.   How does a 
framework activity change as 
the nature of the 
project changes? ?pre22126_ch03_029-039.indd   33pre22126_ch03_029-039.indd   3313/12/13   6:10 PM13/12/13   6:10 PM
