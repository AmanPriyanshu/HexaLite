TESTING MOBILEAPPS 583 
 
 
Interface design books are plentiful. Many of them contain information on testing MobileApp usability. The book by Ben Shneiderman and colleagues ( 
Designing the User Experience 
, 5th ed., Addison-Wesley, 2009) is a classic work on usability. Other good gen-
eral references are books by Quesenberry and Szuc ( Global UX: Design and Research 
in a Connected World,
 
 Morgan Kaufmann, 2011) and Schumacher ( 
Handbook of Global User Research
 
, Morgan Kaufmann, 2009). Nielsen ( Mobile Usability 
, New Riders, 2012)  offers advice on how to design usable interfaces that take mobile-device screen size into  account. Colborne ( Simple and Usable Web, Mobile, and Interaction Design
 
, New Riders, 2010) describes the process of simplifying user interaction. Ginsburg ( Designing the iPhone User Experience: A User-Centered Approach to Sketching and Prototyping iPhone Apps
 
, Addison-Wesley, 2010) discusses the importance of taking a user-centric approach to as-

sessing the user experience.   
 
Meier (The  Microsoft Application Architecture Guide
 
, 2nd ed. Microsoft Press, 2009) has edited a book that contains useful information on mobile application testing. A book 
by Graham ( Experiences of Test Automation: Case Studies of Software Test Automation,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 2012) provides good background on testing automation. Lee ( 
Test-Driven 
iOS Development 
, Addison-Wesley, 2012) discusses the MobileApp testing process in the 
context of test-driven design.   
 
A wide variety of information sources on WebApp testing is available on the Internet. 
An up-to-date list of World Wide Web references can be found under “software engineering
