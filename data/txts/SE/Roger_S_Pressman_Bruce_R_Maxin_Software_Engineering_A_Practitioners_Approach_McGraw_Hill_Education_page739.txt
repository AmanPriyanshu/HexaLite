CHAPTER 32  
PROCESS AND PROJECT METRICS 709speciﬁ c conventions for measurement are established in advance. However, the 
quality and functionality of software or its efﬁ ciency or maintainability are more 
difﬁ cult to assess and can be measured only indirectly. 
 We have partitioned the software metrics domain into process, project, and 
product metrics and noted that product metrics that are private to an individual 
are often combined to develop project metrics that are public to a software team. 
Project metrics are then consolidated to create process metrics that are public 
to the software organization as a whole. But how does an organization combine 
metrics that come from different individuals or projects?   
 
 
 
 
To illustrate, consider a simple example. Individuals on two different project 
teams record and categorize all errors that they ﬁ nd during the software pro-
cess. Individual measures are then combined to develop team measures. Team A 

found 342 errors during the software process prior to release. Team B found 184 

errors. All other things being equal, which team is more effective in uncovering 
errors throughout the process? Because you do not know the size or complexity 
of the projects, you cannot answer this question. However, if the measures are 

normalized, it is possible to create software metrics that enable comparison to 
broader organizational averages.

Size-Oriented Metrics  
Size-oriented software metrics are derived by normalizing quality and/or productivity measures by considering the  size 
 of the software that has been 
produced. If a software organization maintains simple records, a table of 
 size-oriented measures, such as the one shown in   
Figure 32.2  
, can be created. The table lists each software development project that has been completed over 
the past few years and corresponding measures for that project. Referring to the 
table entry (

) for project  alpha 
: 12,100 lines of code were developed person-months of effort at a cost of $168,000. It should be noted that the 
   Because many factors 
affect software work, 
don’t use metrics to 
compare individuals or 
teams. ProjectLOCEffort$(000)Pp. doc.ErrorsDefectsPeople
