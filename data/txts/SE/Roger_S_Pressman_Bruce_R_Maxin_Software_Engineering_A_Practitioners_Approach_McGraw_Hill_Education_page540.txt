QUALITY MANAGEMENThave the expected relationship to one another” [Bei95]. Stated in another way, 
software testing begins by creating a graph of important objects and their rela-
tionships and then devising a series of tests that will cover the graph so that each 
object and relationship is exercised and errors are uncovered.   
To accomplish these steps, you begin by creating a  
graph 
—a collection of  nodes 
 that represent objects,  links 
 that represent the relationships between objects, 
 node weights 
 that describe the properties of a node (e.g., a speciﬁ
 c data value 
or state behavior), and  link weights 
 that describe some characteristic of a link.  The symbolic representation of a graph is shown in  Figure 23.8a . Nodes are represented as circles connected by links that take a number of different forms. 
A  directed link
 
 (represented by an arrow) indicates that a relationship moves in 
only one direction. A  bidirectional link,
 
 also called a  
symmetric link, 
 implies that 
the relationship applies in both directions.  Parallel links 
 are used when a num-
ber of different relationships are established between graph nodes.   As a simple example, consider a portion of a graph for a word-processing application ( Figure 23.8b ) where

  Referring to the ﬁ gure, a menu select on  
newFile 
 generates a document win-
dow. The node weight of  
documentWindow
 
 provides a list of the window attributes 
   A graph represents the 
relationships between 
data objects and pro-
gram objects, enabling 
us to derive test cases 
that search for errors 

associated with these 
relationships.
