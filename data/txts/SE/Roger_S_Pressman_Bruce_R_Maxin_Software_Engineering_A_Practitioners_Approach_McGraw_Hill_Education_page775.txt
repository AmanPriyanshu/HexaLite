 5  “productivity parameter” that reﬂ ects: overall process maturity and 
management practices, the extent to which good software engineering 
practices are used, the level of programming languages used, the state 
of the software environment, the skills and experience of the software 
team, and the complexity of the application  
 
  Typical values might be  
P 
 5 2,000 for development of real-time embedded soft-
ware,  P 
 5 10,000 for telecommunication and systems software, and  
P 
 5 28,000 
for business systems applications. The productivity parameter can be derived 

for local conditions using historical data collected from past development 

efforts. 
 You should note that the software equation has two independent parameters: 
(1) an estimate of size (in LOC) and (2) an indication of project duration in calen-
dar months or years.  To simplify the estimation process and use a more common form for their esti-
mation model, Putnam and Myers [Put92] suggest a set of equations derived from 
the software equation. Minimum development time is deﬁ ned as

 Note that  t 
 in Equation (33.5b) is represented in years.  Using Equation (33.5) with  P 
  5 12,000 (the recommended value for scientiﬁ
 c 
software) for the CAD software discussed previously in this chapter,

 5 58 person-months  The results of the software equation correspond favorably with the estimates de-veloped in Section 33.6. Like the COCOMO model noted in Section 33.7.2, the 
software equation continues to evolve. Further discussion of an extended version 
of this estimation approach can be found in [Put97b].

 increases slowly as “the need for integration, testing, quality assurance, documentation, and 
management skills grows” [Put92]. For small programs (KLOC 5 5 to 15),
