 es navigation nodes (e.g., content) and then links that en-
able navigation between them. The WoN are then organized into NSUs. 
  
 
17.8.2  Navigation Syntax 
 
 
 
   
As design proceeds, your next task is to deﬁ ne the mechanics of navigation. Most 
websites make use of one or more of the following navigation options for imple-
menting each NSU: individual navigation links, horizontal or vertical navigation 
bars (lists), tabs, or access to a complete site map.   
 
 
 
 
In addition to choosing the mechanics of navigation, you should also es-tablish appropriate navigation conventions and aids. For example, icons and 
graphical links should look “clickable” by beveling the edges to give the image a 
three-dimensional look. Audio or visual feedback should be designed to provide 
the user with an indication that a navigation option has been chosen. For text-
based navigation, color should be used to indicate navigation links and to provide 
an indication of links already traveled. These are but a few of dozens of design 
conventions that make navigation user-friendly.

OMPONENT-LEVEL DESIGN  
 
Modern WebApps deliver increasingly sophisticated processing functions that 
(1) perform localized processing to generate content and navigation capability in 
a dynamic fashion, (2) provide computation or data processing capability that are 
appropriate for the WebApp’s business domain, (3) provide sophisticated data-

base query and access, and (4) establish data interfaces with external corporate 
systems. To achieve these (and many other) capabilities, you must design and

Creating an NSU 
 
    In most situations, 
choose either 
horizontal or 
vertical navigation 

mechanisms, but 
not both.    The site map should be 

accessible from every 

page. The map itself 
should be organized 
so that the structure of 

WebApp information is 

readily apparent. pre22126_ch17_371-390.indd   387pre22126_ch17_371-390.indd   38713/12/13   6:13 PM13/12/13   6:13 PM
