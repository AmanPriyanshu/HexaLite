MANAGING SOFTWARE PROJECTS
risks overwhelm a software project team. Bernstein ( Against the Gods, 
 Wiley, 1998) presents 
an entertaining history of risk that goes back to ancient times.  The Software Engineering Institute has published many detailed reports and guidebooks on risk analysis and management. The Air Force Systems Command pamphlet AFSCP 800-
45 [AFC88] describes risk identiﬁ cation and reduction techniques. Every issue of the  
ACM Software Engineering Notes
 
 has a section entitled “Risks to the Public” (editor, P. G. Neu-
mann). If you want the latest and best software horror stories, this is the place to go.  A wide variety of information sources on software risk management is available on the Internet. An up-to-date list of World Wide Web references can be found under “software 

engineering resources” at the SEPA website:
