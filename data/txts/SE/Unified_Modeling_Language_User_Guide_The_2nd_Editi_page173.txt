Part IV: Basic Behavioral Modeling   Chapter 15. Interactions In this chapter · Roles, links, messages, actions, and sequences · Modeling flows of control · Creating well-structured algorithms In every interesting system, objects don't just sit idle; they interact with one another by passing messages. An interaction is a behavior that comprises a set of messages exchanged among a set of objects within a context to accomplish a purpose. You use interactions to model the dynamic aspect of collaborations, representing societies of objects playing specific roles, all working together to carry out some behavior that's bigger than the sum of the elements. These roles represent prototypical instances of classes, interfaces, components, nodes, and use cases. Their dynamic aspects are visualized, specified, constructed,
