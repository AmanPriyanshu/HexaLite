Relationships are discussed in Chapters 5 and 10. You can also organize nodes by specifying dependency, generalization, and association (including aggregation) relationships among them. Connections The most common kind of relationship you'll use among nodes is an association. In this context, an association represents a physical connection among nodes, such as an Ethernet connection, a serial line, or a shared bus, as Figure 26-4 shows. You can even use associations to model indirect connections, such as a satellite link between distant processors. Figure 26-4 Connections  Because nodes are class-like, you have the full power of associations at your disposal. This means that you can include roles, multiplicity, and constraints. As in the previous figure, you should stereotype these associations if you want to model new kinds of connections#for example, to distinguish between a 10-T Ethernet connection and an RS-232 serial connection. Common Modeling Techniques Modeling Processors and Devices Modeling the processors and devices that form the topology of a stand-alone, embedded, client/server, or distributed system is the most common use of nodes. The UML's extensibility mechanisms are discussed in Chapter 6. Because all of the UML's extensibility mechanisms apply to nodes, you will often use stereotypes to specify new kinds of nodes that you can use to represent specific kinds of processors and devices. A processor is a node that has processing capability, meaning that it can execute a component. A device is a node that has no processing capability (at least, none that are modeled at this level of abstraction) and, in general, represents something that interfaces to the real world. To model processors and devices, Â· Identify the computational elements of your system's deployment view and model each as a node.
