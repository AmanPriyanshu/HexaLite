the process area as required; all work tasks and work products are “mon-
itored, controlled, and reviewed; and are evaluated for adherence to the 
process description” [CMM07]. 
 
 
Level 3:
 
  
Deﬁ
 ned
 
— All capability level 2 criteria have been achieved. In 
addition, the process is “tailored from the organization’s set of standard 
processes according to the organization’s tailoring guidelines, and con-
tributes work products, measures, and other process-improvement infor-
mation to the organizational process assets” [CMM07]. 
 
 
Level 4:
 
  
Quantitatively managed 
— All capability level 3 criteria have been 
achieved. In addition, the process area is controlled and improved using 
measurement and quantitative assessment. “Quantitative objectives for 
quality and process performance are established and used as criteria in 
managing the process” [CMM07]. 
 
 
Level 5: 
 
 
Optimized
 
— All capability level 4 criteria have been achieved. In 
addition, the process area is adapted and optimized using quantitative 
(statistical) means to meet changing customer needs and to continually 
improve the efﬁ
 cacy of the process area under consideration. 
 
The CMMI deﬁ
 nes each process area in terms of “speciﬁ
 c goals” and the “speciﬁ
 c 
practices” required to achieve these goals.  
Speciﬁ
 c goals
 
 establish the character-
istics that must exist if the activities implied by a process area are to be effective. 
 
Speciﬁ
 c practices
 
 reﬁ
 ne a goal into a set of process-related activities. 
   Every organization 
should strive to 
achieve the intent of 
the CMMI. However, 
implementing every 
aspect of the model 
may be overkill in your 
situation.
