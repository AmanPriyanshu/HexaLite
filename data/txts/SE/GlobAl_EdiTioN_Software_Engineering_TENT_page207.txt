˜˜˚˛˜˜˜˜˜˜ˆ˛ˇ˜˜˜5. The weather data summary is computed and returned to WeatherStation via the Commslink object.6. WeatherStation then calls the SatComms object to transmit the summarized data 
to the weather information system, through the satellite communications system.The 
SatComms and 
WeatherStation objects may be implemented as concurrent 
processes, whose execution can be suspended and resumed. The 
SatComms object 
instance listens for messages from the external system, decodes these messages, and initiates weather station operations.Sequence diagrams are used to model the combined behavior of a group of objects, 
but you may also want to summarize the behavior of an object or a subsystem in response 

to messages and events. To do this, you can use a state machine model that shows how 

the object instance changes state depending on the messages that it receives. As I discuss 

in Chapter 5, the UML includes state diagrams to describe state machine models.Figure 7.
8 is a state diagram for the weather station system that shows how it 
responds to requests for various services.You can read this diagram as follows:1.
 If the system state is Shutdown, then it can respond to a restart(), a reconfigure() 
or a powerSave() message. The unlabeled arrow with the black blob indicates 
that the Shutdown state is the initial state. A restart() message causes a transition 
to normal operation. Both the powerSave() and reconfigure() messages cause a 
transition to a state in which the system reconfigures itself. The state diagram 

shows that reconfiguration is allowed only if the system has been shut down.transmission doneremoteControl()reportStatus()
