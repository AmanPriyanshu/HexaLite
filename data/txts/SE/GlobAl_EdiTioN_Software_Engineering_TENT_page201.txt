the Report weather use case from Figure 7.2 that is based on this approach.ˇˇOnce the interactions between the software system and the system™s environment 

have been defined, you use this information as a basis for designing the system archi

tecture. Of course, you need to combine this knowledge with your general knowl-
edge of the principles of architectural design and with more detailed domain 

knowledge. You identify the major components that make up the system and their 
interactions. You may then design the system organization using an architectural 

pattern such as a layered or clientŒserver model.The high-level architectural design for the weather station software is shown in 
Figure 7.

instruments in the collection period to the weather information system. The data sent are the 
maximum, minimum, and average ground and air temperatures; the maximum, minimum, 
and average air pressures; the maximum, minimum and average wind speeds; the total 
rainfall; and the wind direction as sampled at 5-minute intervals.StimulusThe weather information system establishes a satellite communication link with the weather 
station and requests transmission of the data.ResponseThe summarized data is sent to the weather information system.CommentsWeather stations are usually asked to report once per hour, but this frequency may differ 
from one station to another and may be modified in future.
