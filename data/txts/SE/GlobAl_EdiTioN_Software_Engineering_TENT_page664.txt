˜Effective communication is achieved when communications are two-way and 
the people involved can discuss issues and information and establish a common 
understanding of proposals and problems. All this can be done through meetings, 

although these meetings are often dominated by powerful personalities. Informal 

discussions when a manager meets with the team for coffee are sometimes more 

effective.More and more project teams include remote members, which also makes meet-ings more difficult. To involve them in communications, you may make use of 

wikis and blogs to support information exchange. Wikis support the collaborative 

creation and editing of documents, and blogs support threaded discussions about 

questions and comments made by group members. Wikis and blogs allow project 

members and external stakeholders to exchange information, irrespective of their 

location. They help manage information and keep track of discussion threads, 

which often become confusing when conducted by email. You can also use instant 

messaging and teleconferences, which can be easily arranged, to resolve issues that 

need discussion.˜˝˜˝
