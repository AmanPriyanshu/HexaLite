MODELINGcontent objects or WebApp functions. As each user interacts with the WebApp, 
she encounters a series of  navigation semantic units 
 (NSUs)—“a set of informa-
tion and related navigation structures that collaborate in the fulﬁ llment of a sub-
set of related user requirements” [Cac02].  An NSU is composed of a set of navigation elements called  ways of navigat-ing 
 (WoN) [Gna99]. A WoN represents the best navigation pathway to achieve a 
navigational goal for a speciﬁ c type of user. Each WoN is organized as a set of 
 navigational nodes 
 (NN) that are connected by navigational links. In some cases, 
a navigational link may be another NSU. Therefore, the overall navigation struc-
ture for a WebApp may be organized as a hierarchy of NSUs. 
 To illustrate the development of an NSU, consider the use case  
Select Safe-Home Components 
: 
 
Use Case: Select SafeHome Components  
 
 
 
 
 
The WebApp will recommend  
product components  (e.g., control panels, sen-sors, cameras) and other features (e.g., PC-based functionality implemented in 
software) for each  room  and  exterior entrance . If I request alternatives, the WebApp will provide them, if they exist. I will be able to get  
descriptive andpricing information  for each product component. The WebApp will create and 
display a  bill-of-materials  as I select various components. I’ll be able to give the bill-of-materials a name and save it for future reference (see use case  Save Conﬁ guration
 
).    
 
The underlined items in the use-case description represent classes and con-tent objects that will be incorporated into one or more NSUs that will enable a 
new customer to perform the scenario described in the  Select SafeHome Com-ponents 
 use case.   
Figure 17.9  depicts a partial semantic analysis of the navigation implied 
by the  Select SafeHome Components 
 
 
 use case. Using the terminology in-
troduced earlier, the ﬁ
 gure also represents a way of navigating (WoN) for the 
   
SafeHomeAssured.com 
 
 WebApp. Important problem domain classes are shown 
along with selected content objects (in this case the package of content objects 
named CompDescription, an attribute of the  
ProductComponent 
 class). These items 
are navigation nodes. Each of the arrows represents a navigation link  9 
 
 and is 
labeled with the user-initiated action that causes the link to occur. 
 
 
  You can create an NSU for each use case associated with each user role. For 
example, a  new customer 
 for   
 
SafeHomeAssured.com 
 
 may have three different 
use cases, all resulting in access to different information and WebApp functions. 

An NSU is created for each goal.  During the initial stages of navigation design, the WebApp content archi-
tecture is assessed to determine one or more WoN for each use case. As noted 
   An NSU describes 
the navigation 
requirements for each 
use case. In essence, 
the NSU shows how an 
actor moves between 
content objects or 
WebApp functions. 
  uote:  ”The problem of 
website navigation 
is conceptual, 
technical, spatial, 
philosophical 
and logistic. 
Consequently, 

solutions tend to 
call for complex 
improvisational 
combinations of 
art, science and 
organizational 
psychology.”
