ADVANCED TOPICS
 
 
 
38.2.  Why does open-world software present a challenge to conventional software engineer-
ing approaches?    
 
38.3.  Review the Gartner Group’s  
hype cycle for emerging technologies
.  Select a well-known 
technology product and present a brief history that illustrates how it traveled along the 
curve. Select another well-known technology product that did not follow the path suggested 
by the hype curve.    
 
38.4.  What is a “soft trend”?    
 
38.5.  You’re faced with an extremely complex problem that will require a lengthy solution. 
How would you go about addressing the complexity and crafting a solution?    
 
38.6.  What are “emergent requirements” and why do they present a challenge to software engineers?    
 
38.7.  Select an open-source development effort (other than Linux), and present a brief his-tory of its evolution and relative success.    
 
38.8.  Describe how you think the software process will change over the next decade.    
 
38.9.  You’re based in Los Angeles and are working on a global software engineering team. 
You and colleagues in London, Mumbai, Hong Kong, and Sydney must edit a 245-page 

requirements speciﬁ cation for a large system. The ﬁ
 rst editing pass must be completed 
in three days. Describe the ideal online tool set that would enable you to collaborate 

effectively. 
   
 
38.10.  Describe model-driven software development in your own words. Do the same for test-driven development.

Books that discuss the road ahead for software and computing span a vast array of techni-cal, scientiﬁ c, economic, political, and social issues. Kurweil ( 
The Singularity Is Near,
 
 Pen-
guin Books, 2005) and ( How to Create a Mind,
 
 Viking, 2012) presents a compelling look at a 
world that will change in truly profound ways by the middle of this century. Sterling ( 
Tomor-
row Now,
 
 Random House, 2002) reminds us that real progress is rarely orderly and efﬁ
 cient. 
Books by Nanz ( The Future of Software Engineering,
 
 Springer, 2010) and Draheim and his 
colleagues ( Software Engineering Tools: Trends of Software Engineering Tools and Platforms, 
2010 
) discuss trends in software development. Meisel ( The Software Society: Cultural and 
Economic Impact, 
 Trafford, 2013), Saylor ( 
The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will 
Change Everything, 
 Vanguard Press, 2012), Dourish and Bell ( 
Divining a Digital Future: Mess 
and Mythology in Ubiquitous Computing, 
 MIT Press, 2011) and Teich ( 
Technology and the 
Future,
 
 12th ed., Wadworth, 2012) present thoughtful essays on the societal impact of tech-
nology and how changing culture shapes technology. Philips and Naisbitt ( 
High Tech/High 
Touch,
 
 Nicholas Brealey, 2001) note that many of us have become “intoxicated” with high 
technology and that the “great irony of the high-tech age is that we’ve become enslaved to 
devices that were supposed to give us freedom.” Zey ( The Future Factor,
 
 Transaction Pub-
lishers, 2004) discusses forces that will shape human destiny during this century. Negropon-

te’s  
(Being Digital, 
 Alfred A. Knopf, 1995) was a best seller in the mid-1990s and continues to 
provide an insightful view of computing and its overall impact.   
 
As software becomes part of the fabric of virtually every facet of our lives, “cyberethics” has evolved as an important topic of discussion. Books by Quninn ( Ethics for the Information Age, 
 5th ed., Addison-Wesley, 2012), Spinello ( 
Cyberethics: Morality and Law in Cyberspace
 
, 4th ed., Jones & Bartlett Publishers, 2010), Tavini ( 
Ethics and Technology,
 
 3rd ed., Wiley, 
2010), Halbert and Ingulli ( Cyberethics,
 
 2nd ed., South-Western College Publishers, 2004), 
and Baird and his colleagues ( Cyberethics: Social and Moral Issues in the Computer Age
 
, Prometheus Books, 2000) consider the topic in detail. The U.S. government has published pre22126_ch38_839-859.indd   858pre22126_ch38_839-859.indd   85813/12/13   6:17 PM13/12/13   6:17 PM
