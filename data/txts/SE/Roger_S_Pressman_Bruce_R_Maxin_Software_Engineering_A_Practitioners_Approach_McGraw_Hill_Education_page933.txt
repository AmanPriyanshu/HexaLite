APPENDIX 3  
FORMAL METHODS 903  
 Note that each expression starts with the keyword  
contextcontext . This indicates 
the element of the UML diagram that the expression constrains. The key-
word   
self   here refers to the instance of   
BlockHandler;   in the following, as is 
permissible in OCL, we will omit the   
self  .  
  
 2.  All the sets of blocks held in the queue will be subsets of the collection of 
currently used blocks.  
   context BlockHandler inv:

     blockQueue–>forAll(aBlockSet | used–>includesAll(aBlockSet ))    
  
 3.  No elements of the queue will contain the same block numbers.  
   context BlockHandler inv:   

 blockQueue–>forAll(blockSet1, blockSet2 |

    blockSet1 <> blockSet2 implies  
  blockSet1.elements.number–> excludesAll(blockSet2.elements.number))   
  
 The expression before   
implies   is needed to ensure we ignore pairs where 
both elements are the same block.  
   4.
  The collection of used blocks and blocks that are unused will be the total 
collection of blocks that make up ﬁ les.  
   context BlockHandler inv:

    
 allBlocks 5 used–>union(free)    
  
 5.  The collection of unused blocks will have no duplicate block numbers.  
   context BlockHandler inv:

     free–>isUnique(aBlock | aBlock.number)    
  
 6.  The collection of used blocks will have no duplicate block numbers.  
   context BlockHandler inv:  

   used–>isUnique(aBlock | aBlock.number)
