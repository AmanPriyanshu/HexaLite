THE CMMI 
 
 
The original CMM was developed and upgraded by the Software Engineering In-stitute throughout the 1990s as a complete SPI framework. Today, it has evolved 

into the  Capability Maturity Model Integration 
 (CMMI) [CMM07], a comprehen-
sive process meta-model that is predicated on a set of system and software en-
gineering capabilities that should be present as organizations reach different 
levels of process capability and maturity. 
 The CMMI represents a process meta-model in two different ways: (1) as a “continuous” model and (2) as a “staged” model. The continuous CMMI 
 meta-model describes a process in two dimensions as illustrated in   
37.2 
 
. Each process area (e.g., project planning or requirements management) is for-

mally assessed against speciﬁ c goals and practices and is rated according to the 
following  capability levels:   
 
Level 0:   Incomplete 
— The process area (e.g., requirements management) is either not performed or does not achieve all goals and objectives de-
ﬁ ned by the CMMI for level 1 capability for the process area. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Level 1: 
  Performed 
— All of the speciﬁ c goals of the process area (as de-
ﬁ ned by the CMMI) have been satisﬁ
 ed. Work tasks required to produce 
deﬁ ned work products are being conducted. 
  
Level 2: 
  Managed 
— All capability level 1 criteria have been satisﬁ ed. In 
addition, all work associated with the process area conforms to an orga-
nizationally deﬁ ned policy; all people doing the work have access to ade-
quate resources to get the job done; stakeholders are actively involved in pre22126_ch37_817-838.indd   828pre22126_ch37_817-838.indd   82813/12/13   6:17 PM13/12/13   6:17 PM
