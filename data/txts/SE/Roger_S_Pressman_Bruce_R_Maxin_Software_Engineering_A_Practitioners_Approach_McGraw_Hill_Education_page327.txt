The scene:  
Jamie’s cubicle. 
   
 
 
 
The players:  
Jamie and Ed—members of the  Safe-Home 
 software engineering team who are working on the surveillance function. 
   
 
 
 
The conversation:  
   
 
 
 
Ed:  
I have a ﬁ rst-cut design of the  
camera 
 component.    
 
 
 
Jamie:  
Wanna do a quick review? 
   
 
 
 
Ed:  
. but really, I’d like your input on something. 
   
 
(Jamie gestures for him to continue.)   
 
 
 
 
Ed:  
We originally deﬁ
 ned ﬁ
 ve operations for  
camera 
.    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
determineType()
 
 tells me the type of camera.     
 
 
 
 
 
translateLocation() 
 allows me to move the camera around the ﬂ oor plan. 
    
 
 
 
 
 
displayID() 
 gets the camera ID and displays it near the camera icon.     
 
 
 
 
 
displayView() 
 shows me the ﬁ eld of view of the 
camera graphically. 
    
 
 
 
 
 
displayZoom() 
 shows me the magniﬁ cation of the 
camera graphically. 
 
 
   
 
 
 
Ed:  
I’ve designed each separately, and they’re pretty 
simple operations. So I thought it might be a good idea 
to combine all of the display operations into just one 
that’s called  
displayCamera() 
—it’ll show the ID, the view, and the zoom. Whaddaya think? 
   
 
 
 
Jamie (grimacing):  
Not sure that’s such a good idea. 
   
 
 
 
Ed (frowning):  
Why? All of these little ops can cause headaches.    
 
 
 
Jamie:  
The problem with combining them is we lose cohesion, you know, the  
displayCamera() 
 op won’t be 
single-minded.    
 
 
 
Ed (mildly exasperated):  
So what? The whole thing will be less than 100 source lines, max. It’ll be 
easier to implement, I think.    
 
 
 
Jamie:  
And what if marketing decides to change the way that we represent the view ﬁ eld? 
   
 
 
 
Ed:  
I just jump into the  displayCamera() 
 op and make the mod.    
 
 
 
Jamie:  
What about side effects?    
 
 
 
Ed:  
Whaddaya mean?    
 
 
 
Jamie:  
Well, say you make the change but inadver-
tently create a problem with the ID display. 
   
 
 
 
Ed:  
I wouldn’t be that sloppy. 
   
 
 
 
Jamie:  
Maybe not, but what if some support person 
two years from now has to make the mod. He might not 
understand the op as well as you do, and, who knows, 
he might be sloppy. 
   
 
 
 
Ed:  
So you’re against it?    
 
 
 
Jamie:  
Y 
be sure you understand the consequences of low cohesion. 
   
 
 
 
Ed (thinking a moment):  
Maybe we’ll go with sep-arate display ops.    
 
 
 
Jamie:  
Good decision.
