 I write about what I know and understand. I have had many suggestions for 
additional topics that might be covered in more detail such as open source 

development, the use of the UML and mobile software engineering. But I don™t 
really know enough about these areas. My own work has been in system depend-
ability and in systems engineering and this is reflected in my selection of 

advanced topics for the book.I believe that the key issues for modern software engineering are managing com
-plexity, integrating agility with other methods and ensuring that our systems are 

secure and resilient. These issues have been the driver for the changes and additions 
in this new edition of my book.In summary, the major updates and additions in this book from the 9th edition are:
material on Scrum. I have updated other chapters as required to reflect the increas-ing use of agile methods of software engineering.
systems of systems.

oriented software engineering.
material on distributed version control systems.









improvement from the print version of the book to the web site.











supporting videos. I have explained key topics on video and recommended related 
YouTube videos.The 4-part structure of the book, introduced in earlier editions, has been retained 
but I have made significant changes in each part of the book.1.
 In Part 1, Introduction to software engineering, I have completely rewritten 
Chapter 3 (agile methods) and updated this to reflect the increasing use of Scrum. 

A new case study on a digital learning environment has been added to Chapter 1 

and is used in a number of chapters. Legacy systems are covered in more detail 

in Chapter 9. Minor changes and updates have been made to all other chapters.
