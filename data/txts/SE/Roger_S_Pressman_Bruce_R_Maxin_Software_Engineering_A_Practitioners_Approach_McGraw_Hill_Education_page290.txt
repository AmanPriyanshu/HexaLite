MODELING 
 
 
 
Call and Return Architectures.   This architectural style enables you to achieve a program structure that is relatively easy to modify and scale. A number of sub-
styles [Bas03] exist within this category:  
 
 
•   
Main program/subprogram architectures.
 
 This classic program structure decomposes function into a control hierarchy where a “main” program 
invokes a number of program components, which in turn may invoke still 
other components.  Figure 13.3  illustrates an architecture of this type.   
 
 
•   
Remote procedure call architectures.
 
 The components of a main program/subprogram architecture are distributed across multiple computers on a 
network.
