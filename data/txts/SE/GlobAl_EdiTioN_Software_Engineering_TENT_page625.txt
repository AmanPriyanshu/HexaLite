wheels. This monitors the state of each wheel to check if the wheel is turning or locked. 
A separate process monitors the pressure on the brake pedal exerted by the car driver.The system includes an anti-skid feature, which is triggered if the sensors indicate that a wheel is locked when the brake has been applied. This means that there is 

insufficient friction between the road and the tire; in other words, the car is skidding. 
If the wheel is locked, the driver cannot steer that wheel. To counteract this effect, 

the system sends a rapid sequence of on/off signals to the brake on that wheel, which 
allows the wheel to turn and control to be regained.The Wheel monitor process monitors whether or not each wheel is turning. If a wheel is skidding (not turning), it informs the Analysis process. This then signals the processes associated with the wheels that are skidding to initiate anti-skid braking.Many real-time systems are concerned with collecting analog data from the system™s 
environment. They then digitize that data for analysis and processing by the system. 
The system may also convert digital data to analog data, which it then sends to its 
environment. For example, a software radio accepts incoming packets of digital data 
representing the radio transmission and transforms the data into a sound signal that 
people can listen to.The data processing involved in many of these systems has to be carried out very 
quickly. Otherwise, incoming data may be lost and outgoing signals may be broken 

up because essential information is missing. The Process Pipeline pattern makes 

this rapid processing possible by breaking down the required data processing into a 

sequence of separate transformations. Each of these transformations is implemented 
NameProcess PipelineDescriptionA pipeline of processes is set up with data moving in sequence 
from one end of the pipeline to another. The processes are often 
linked by synchronized buffers to allow the producer and 
consumer processes to run at different speeds. The culmination 
of a pipeline may be display or data storage, or the pipeline may 
terminate in an actuator.StimuliInput values from the environment or some other processResponsesOutput values to the environment or a shared bufferProcessesProducer, Buffer, ConsumerUsed inData acquisition systems, multi-media systemsFigure 21.12  The Process
