What distinguishes a deployment diagram from all other kinds of diagrams is its particular content. Contents Nodes are discussed in Chapter 26; relationships are discussed in Chapters 5 and 10; components are discussed in Chapter 25; packages are discussed in Chapter 12; subsystems are discussed in Chapter 31; instances are discussed in Chapter 13; class diagrams are discussed in Chapter 8 Deployment diagrams commonly contain
