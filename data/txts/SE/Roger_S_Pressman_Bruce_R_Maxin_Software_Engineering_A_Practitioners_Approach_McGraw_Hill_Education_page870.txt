ADVANCED TOPICS
Some have been widely adopted, but others never reached their potential. Our conclusion: technologies come and go; the real trends that we should explore 
are softer. By this we mean that progress in software engineering will be guided 

by business, organizational, market, and cultural trends. Those trends lead to 
technology innovation.  In this chapter, we’ll mention a few software engineering technology trends, 
but our primary emphasis will be on some of the business, organizational, mar-

ket, and cultural trends that may have an important inﬂ uence on software engi-
neering technology over the next 10 or 20 years.

TECHNOLOGY EVOLUTION  
 
In a fascinating book that provides a compelling look at how computing (and other related) technologies will evolve, Ray Kurzweil [Kur05] argues that techno-
logical evolution is similar to biological evolution, but occurs at a rate that is or-

ders of magnitude faster. Evolution (whether biological or technological) occurs 

as a result of positive feedback—“the more capable methods resulting from one 
stage of evolutionary progress are used to create the next stage” [Kur05].   
 
The big questions for the 21st century are: (1) How rapidly does a technology evolve? (2) How signiﬁ cant are the effects of positive feedback? (3) How profound 
will the resultant changes be?  When a successful new technology is introduced, the initial concept moves through a reasonably predictable “innovation life cycle” [Gai95] illustrated in 
  
Figure 38.1  
. In the  breakthrough
 
 phase, a problem is recognized and repeated 
attempts at a viable solution are attempted. At some point, a solution shows 
promise. The initial breakthrough work is reproduced in the  replicator
 
 phase 
and gains wider usage.  Empiricism 
 leads to the creation of empirical rules that 
govern the use of the technology, and repeated success leads to a broader  
theory 
 of usage that is followed by the creation of automated tools during the  automa-tion 
 phase. Finally, the technology matures and is used widely. 
 
 
 
 
  What are 
the “big questions” when 
we consider 
technology 
evolution? ?   Computing technology 

is evolving at an 
exponential rate, and 
its growth may soon 
become explosive.     test-driven
