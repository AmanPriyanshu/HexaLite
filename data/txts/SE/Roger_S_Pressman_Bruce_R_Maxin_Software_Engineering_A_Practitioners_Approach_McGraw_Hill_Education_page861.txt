The CMMI—Should We or Shouldn’t We? 
 
The CMMI is a process meta-model. It deﬁ nes (in 700
1 pages) the process charac-teristics that should exist if an organization wants to es-
tablish a software process that is complete. The question 
that has been debated for almost two decades is: “Is the 
CMMI overkill?” Like most things in life (and in software), 
the answer is not a simple yes or no.  The spirit of the CMMI should always be adopted. At the risk of oversimpliﬁ cation, it argues that software de-
velopment must be taken seriously—it must be planned 
thoroughly, it must be controlled uniformly, it must be 

tracked accurately, and it must be conducted profession-

ally. It must focus on the needs of project stakeholders, 
the skills of the software engineers, and the quality of the end product. No one would argue with these ideas.  The detailed requirements of the CMMI should be seriously considered if an organization builds large com-
plex systems that involve dozens or hundreds of people 
over many months or years. It may be that the CMMI is 
“just right” in such situations, if the organizational culture 
is amenable to standard process models and manage-
ment is committed to making it a success. However, in 

other situations, the CMMI may simply be too much for 
an organization to successfully assimilate. Does this 
mean that the CMMI is “bad” or “overly bureaucratic”
