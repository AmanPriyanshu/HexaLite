example, consider a banking system that allows customers to query their accounts and withdraw cash from an ATM. The system is composed of two cooperating soft-
ware componentsŠthe ATM software and the account processing software in the 

bank™s database server. The input and output components are implemented as soft-
ware in the ATM, and the processing component is part of the bank™s database 

server. Figure 6.17 shows the architecture of this system, illustrating the functions of 
the input, process, and output components.All systems that involve interaction with a shared database can be considered to be 
transaction-based information systems. An information system allows controlled 

access to a large base of information, such as a library catalog, a flight timetable, or 
the records of patients in a hospital. Information systems are almost always web-
based systems, where the user interface is implemented in a web browser.Figure 6.
