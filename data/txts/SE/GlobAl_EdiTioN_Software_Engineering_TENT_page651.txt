cope with the risk if it arises. These should reduce the overall impact of a risk on 
the project or product.˘˘Risk monitoring is the process of checking that your assumptions about the product, 

process, and business risks have not changed. You should regularly assess each of 
the identified risks to decide whether or not that risk is becoming more or less prob
-
able. You should also think about whether or not the effects of the risk have changed. 
To do this, you have to look at other factors, such as the number of requirements 

change requests, which give you clues about the risk probability and its effects. 

These factors are obviously dependent on the types of risk. Figure 22.6 gives some 
examples of factors that may be helpful in assessing these risk types.You should monitor risks regularly at all stages in a project. At every manage
-ment review, you should consider and discuss each of the key risks separately. You 
should decide if the risk is more or less likely to arise and if the seriousness and 

consequences of the risk have changed.Figure 22.5 Strategies to help manage riskRiskStrategyOrganizational
