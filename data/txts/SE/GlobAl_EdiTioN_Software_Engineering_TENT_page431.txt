The features in this architecture that support the resistance to adverse events are 
also useful in supporting recovery from these events. By maintaining multiple copies of information and having backup hardware available, critical system services can 

be quickly restored to normal operation. Because the system need only be available 
during normal working hours (say, 8 a.m to 6 p.m), the system can be reinstated 

overnight so that it is available for the following day after a failure.As well as maintaining critical services, the other business requirements of main-taining the confidentiality and integrity of patient data must also be supported. The 

architecture shown in Figure 14.12 includes a backup system and explicit database 
integrity checking to reduce the chances that patient information is damaged acci-
dentally or in a malicious attack. Information on client computers is also available 
and can be used to support recovery from data corruption or damage.While maintaining multiple copies of data is a safeguard against data corruption, it poses a risk to confidentiality as all of these copies have to be secured. In this case, 
this risk can be controlled by:1. Only downloading the summary records of patients who are scheduled to attend a clinic. This limits the number of records that could be compromised.2. Encrypting the disk on local client computers. Attackers who do not have the 

encryption key cannot read the disk if they gain access to the computer.3.
 Securely deleting the downloaded information at the end of a clinic session. This 

further reduces the chances of an attacker gaining access to confidential information.MentcareclientMentcare serverPatient database
