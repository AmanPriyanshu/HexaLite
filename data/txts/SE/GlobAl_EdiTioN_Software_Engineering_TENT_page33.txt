ultimately, unconsciousness and death. In the long term, however, continual high 
levels of blood glucose can lead to eye damage, kidney damage, and heart problems.Advances in developing miniaturized sensors have meant that it is now possible to develop automated insulin delivery systems. These systems monitor blood sugar 
levels and deliver an appropriate dose of insulin when required. Insulin delivery 

systems like this one are now available and are used by patients who find it difficult 
to control their insulin levels. In future, it may be possible for diabetics to have such 
systems permanently attached to their bodies.A software-controlled insulin delivery system uses a microsensor embedded in 
the patient to measure some blood parameter that is proportional to the sugar level. 
This is then sent to the pump controller. This controller computes the sugar level and 
the amount of insulin that is needed. It then sends signals to a miniaturized pump to 

deliver the insulin via a permanently attached needle.Figure 1.
4 shows the hardware components and organization of the insulin pump. 
To understand the examples in this book, all you need to know is that the blood sensor 

measures the electrical conductivity of the blood under different conditions and that 

these values can be related to the blood sugar level. The insulin pump delivers one unit 

of insulin in response to a single pulse from a controller. Therefore, to deliver 10 units 

of insulin, the controller sends 10 pulses to the pump. Figure 1.5 is a Unified Modeling
