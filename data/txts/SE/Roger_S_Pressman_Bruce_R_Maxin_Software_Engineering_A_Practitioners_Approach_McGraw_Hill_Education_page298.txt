MODELING 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Referring to the ﬁ gure, systems that interoperate with the  
target system
 
 (the 
system for which an architectural design is to be developed) are represented as:  
 
 
•   
Superordinate systems
 
—those systems that use the target system as part of some higher-level processing scheme. 
  
 
 
•   
Subordinate systems
 
—those systems that are used by the target system and provide data or processing that are necessary to complete target sys-
tem functionality. 
  
 
 
•   
Peer-level systems
 
—those systems that interact on a peer-to-peer basis 
(i.e., information is either produced or consumed by the peers and the tar-

get system.   
 
 
•   
Actors 
—entities (people, devices) that interact with the target system by producing or consuming information that is necessary for requisite 
processing.    
 
Each of these external entities communicates with the target system through an interface (the small shaded rectangles).  To illustrate the use of the ACD, consider the home security function of the  
Safe-Home 
 product. The overall  SafeHome 
 product controller and the  Internet-based system are both superordinate to the security function and are shown above the 
function in  Figure 13.6 . The surveillance function is a  peer system 
 and uses (is 
used by) the home security function in later versions of the product. The home-
owner and control panels are actors that producer and consume information 
used/produced by the security software. Finally, sensors are used by the security 

software and are shown as subordinate to it.
