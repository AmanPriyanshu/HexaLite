CHAPTER 16  
PATTERN-BASED DESIGN
 361patterns. Looking through a number of patterns repositories, you ﬁ nd the follow-
ing patterns, along with the problem that each solves:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
AdvancedSearch. 
 Users must ﬁ
 nd a speciﬁ
 c item in a large collection of items. 
   
 
 
 
 
 
HelpWizard.
 
 Users need help on a certain topic related to the website or 
when they need to ﬁ nd a speciﬁ
 c page within the site. 
   
 
 
 
 
 
SearchArea. 
 Users must ﬁ
 nd a page. 
   
 
 
 
 
 
SearchTips.
 
 Users need to know how to control the search engine. 
   
 
 
 
 
 
SearchResults. 
 Users have to process a list of search results. 
   
 
 
 
 
 
SearchBox. 
 Users have to ﬁ
 nd an item or speciﬁ
 c information. 
 
 
  For  SafeHomeAssured.com 
 the number of products is not particularly large, and 
each has a relatively simple categorization, so  AdvancedSearch 
 and  
HelpWizard
 
 are probably not necessary. Similarly, the search is simple enough not to require 

 SearchTips
 
. The description of  SearchBox 
, however, is given (in part) as:

Problem: 
 The users need to ﬁ
 nd an item or speciﬁ
 c information. 
  
Motivation: 
 Any situation in which a keyword search is applied across a 
collection of content objects organized as Web pages. 
  
Context: 
 Rather than using navigation to acquire information or con-
tent, the user wants to do a direct search through content 
contained on multiple Web pages. Any website that already 

has primary navigation. User may want to search for an item 
in a category. User might want to further specify a query. 
  
Forces: 
 The website already has primary navigation. Users may 
want to search for an item in a category. Users might want to 

further specify a query using simple Boolean operators.   
Solution: 
 Offer search functionality consisting of a search label, a key-
word ﬁ eld, a ﬁ
 lter if applicable and a “go” button. Pressing 
the return key has the same function as selecting the go 
button. Also provide Search Tips and examples in a separate 

page. A link to that page is placed next to the search func-
tionality. The edit box for the search term is large enough to 

accommodate three typical user queries (typically around 
20 characters). If the number of ﬁ lters is more than 2, use a 
combo box for ﬁ lters selection, otherwise a radio button. 
  The search results are presented on a new page with a clear 
label containing at least “Search results” or similar. The search 

function is repeated in the top part of the page with the entered 

keywords, so that the users know what the keywords were. 
  
The pattern description continues with other entries as described in Section 16.1.3.  pre22126_ch16_347-370.indd   361pre22126_ch16_347-370.indd   36116/12/13   6:22 PM16/12/13   6:22 PM
