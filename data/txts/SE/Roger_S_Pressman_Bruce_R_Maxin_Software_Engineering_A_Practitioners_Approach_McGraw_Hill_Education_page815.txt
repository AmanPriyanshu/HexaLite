CHAPTER 35  
RISK MANAGEMENT 785reevaluated to accomplish second-order prioritization. Referring to   
Figure 35.3  
, risk impact and probability have a distinct inﬂ uence on management concern. A 
risk factor that has a high impact but a very low probability of occurrence should 
not absorb a signiﬁ cant amount of management time. However, high-impact 
risks with moderate to high probability and low-impact risks with high probabil-
ity should be carried forward into the risk analysis steps that follow. 
 
 
 
 
 
  All risks that lie above the cutoff line should be managed. The column labeled RMMM contains a pointer into a  risk mitigation, monitoring, and management plan 
 or, alternatively, a collection of risk information sheets developed for all 
risks that lie above the cutoff. The RMMM plan and risk information sheets are 
discussed in Sections 35.5 and 35.6.  Risk probability can be determined by making individual estimates and then developing a single consensus value. Although that approach is workable, more 
sophisticated techniques for determining risk probability have been developed 
(e.g., [McC09]).

Assessing Risk Impact  
Three factors affect the consequences that are likely if a risk does occur: its na-ture, its scope, and its timing. The nature of the risk indicates the problems that 
are likely if it occurs. For example, a poorly deﬁ ned external interface to cus-
tomer hardware (a technical risk) will preclude early design and testing and will 
likely lead to system integration problems late in a project. The scope of a risk 
combines the severity (just how serious is it?) with its overall distribution (how

has the luxury of 

getting to know a 
task so well that it 
holds no surprises, 
and surprises mean 
risk.”  Stephen Grey
