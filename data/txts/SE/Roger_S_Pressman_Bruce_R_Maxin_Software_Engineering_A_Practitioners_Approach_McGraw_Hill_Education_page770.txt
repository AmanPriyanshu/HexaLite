compared and reconciled. If both sets of estimates show reasonable agreement, there is good reason to believe that the estimates are reliable. If, on the other 
hand, the results of these decomposition techniques show little agreement, fur-

ther investigation and analysis must be conducted.

An Example of Process-Based Estimation 
 
To illustrate the use of process-based estimation, we again consider the CAD 
software introduced in Section 33.6.3. The system conﬁ guration and all software 
functions remain unchanged and are indicated by project scope.   Referring to the completed process-based table shown in   
Figure 33.4  
, esti-mates of effort (in person-months) for each software engineering activity are pro-
vided for each CAD software function (abbreviated for brevity). The engineering 
and construction release activities are subdivided into the major software engi-
neering tasks shown. Gross estimates of effort are provided for customer com-
munication, planning, and risk analysis. These are noted in the total row at the 
bottom of the table. Horizontal and vertical totals provide an indication of esti-
mated effort required for analysis, design, code, and test. It should be noted that 
53 percent of all effort is expended on front-end engineering tasks (requirements 
analysis and design), indicating the relative importance of this work.  Based on an average burdened labor rate of $8,000 per month, the total esti-mated project cost is $368,000 and the estimated effort is 46 person-months. If 
desired, labor rates could be associated with each framework activity or software 
engineering task and computed separately.

Estimation with Use Cases  
As we have noted throughout Part 2 of this book, use cases provide a software team with insight into software scope and requirements. Once use cases have

understand the 
background of an 
estimate before 
you use it.”  Barry Boehm
