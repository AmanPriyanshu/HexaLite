  Chapter 20. Events and Signals In this chapter 路 Signal events, call events, time events, and change events 路 Modeling a family of signals 路 Modeling exceptions 路 Handling events in active and passive objects In the real world, things happen. Not only do things happen, but lots of things may happen at the same time, and at the most unexpected times. "Things that happen" are called events, and each one represents the specification of a significant occurrence that has a location in time and space. In the context of state machines, you use events to model the occurrence of a stimulus that can trigger a state transition. Events may include signals, calls, the passing of time, or a change in state. Events may be synchronous or asynchronous, so modeling events is wrapped up in the modeling of processes and threads.
