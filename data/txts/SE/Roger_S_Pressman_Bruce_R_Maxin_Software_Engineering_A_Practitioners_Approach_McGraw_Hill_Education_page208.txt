178 PART TWO  
MODELINGThe  precondition
 
 describes what is known to be true before the use case is initi-
ated. The  trigger 
 identiﬁ
 es the event or condition that “gets the use case started” 
[Coc01b]. The  scenario 
 lists the speciﬁ
 c actions that are required by the actor and 
the appropriate system responses.  Exceptions 
 identify the situations uncovered 
as the preliminary use case is reﬁ ned (Section 9.2.2). Additional headings may or 
may not be included and are reasonably self-explanatory.

Primary actor:    
Homeowner. 
  
Goal in context:    
To view output of camera placed 
throughout the house from any 
remote location via the Internet. 
  
Preconditions:    
System must be fully conﬁ gured;

 9.  
The homeowner selects the “view” button.    
 
 
10.  The system displays a viewing window that is identiﬁ ed by the camera ID. 
   
 
 
11.  The system displays video output within the view-ing window at one frame per second.    
 
Exceptions:   
 
 1.  
ID or passwords are incorrect or not recognized—see use case  Validate ID and passwords.
 
 
   
 
 2.  
Surveillance function not conﬁ
 gured for this 
system—system displays appropriate error mes-
sage; see use case  Conﬁ gure surveillance 
function. 
 
   
 
 3.  
Homeowner selects “View thumbnail snapshots for all camera”—see use case  View thumbnail 
snapshots for all cameras. 
 
   
 
 4.  
A ﬂ oor plan is not available or has not been 
 conﬁ gured—display appropriate error message

Priority:    
Moderate priority, to be imple-
mented after basic functions.    
 
 
 
When available:    
Third increment.    
 
 
 
Frequency of use:    
Infrequent.    
 
 
 
Channel to actor:    
Via PC-based browser and  Internet connection. 
   
 
 
 
Secondary actors:

Channels to secondary actors:    
 
 
 1.  
System administrator: PC-based system.    
 
 2.  
Cameras: wireless connectivity. 
   
 
Open issues:    
 
 
 1.  
What mechanisms protect unauthorized use of this capability by employees of  SafeHome Products 
?    
 
 2.  
Is security sufﬁ cient? Hacking into this feature 
would represent a major invasion of privacy. 
   
 
 3.  
Will system response via the Internet be accept-
able given the bandwidth required for camera 
views?    
 
 4.  
Will we develop a capability to provide video 
at a higher frames-per-second rate when high- 

bandwidth connections are available?
