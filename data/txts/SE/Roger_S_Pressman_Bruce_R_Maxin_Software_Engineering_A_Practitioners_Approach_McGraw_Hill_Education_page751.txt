Metrics Collection, Computation, and Evaluation  
The process for establishing a metrics baseline is illustrated in   
Figure 32.3  
. Ideally, 
data needed to establish a baseline have been collected in an ongoing manner. 

Sadly, this is rarely the case. Therefore, data collection requires an historical 

investigation of past projects to reconstruct required data. Once measures have 
been collected (unquestionably the most difﬁ cult step), metrics computation is 
possible. Depending on the breadth of measures collected, metrics can span 
a broad range of application-oriented metrics (e.g., LOC, FP, object-oriented, 

 WebApp) as well as other quality- and project-oriented metrics. Finally, metrics 
must be evaluated and applied during estimation, technical work, project con-
trol, and process improvement. Metrics evaluation focuses on the underlying 
reasons for the results obtained and produces a set of indicators that guide the 
project or process.

METRICS FOR SMALL ORGANIZATIONS
  
 
The vast majority of software development organizations have fewer than 20 soft-ware people. It is unreasonable, and in most cases unrealistic, to expect that such 
organizations will develop comprehensive software metrics programs. However, 

it is reasonable to suggest that software organizations  10 
 
 of all sizes measure and 
then use the resultant metrics to help improve their local software process and 
the quality and timeliness of the products they produce.   
 
 
A small organization can begin by focusing not on measurement but rather on results. The software group is polled to deﬁ ne a single objective that requires 
   If you’re just starting 
to collect metrics data, 
remember to keep it 
simple. If you bury 

yourself with data, 
your metrics effort 

will fail.   
10  This discussion is equally relevant to software teams that have adopted an agile software de-
velopment process (Chapter 5). SoftwareengineeringprocessSoftwareprojectSoftwareproductDatacollectionMetricscomputationMetricsevaluationMeasuresMetricsIndicators FIGURE 32.3
