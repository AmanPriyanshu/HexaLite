˚˛˝˙ˆˇ˘˜˜˚˜˜˜˜˜The names chosen in the state machine diagram are descriptive. The associated 
information indicates actions taken by the system actuators or information that is 

displayed. Notice that this system never terminates but idles in a waiting state when 

the pump is not operating.The fuel delivery system is designed to allow unattended operation, with the fol-lowing sequence of actions:1. The buyer inserts a credit card into a card reader built into the pump. This causes a transition to a Reading state where the card details are read and the buyer is then asked to remove the card.2. Removal of the card triggers a transition to a Validating state where the card is validated.3. If the card is valid, the system initializes the pump and, when the fuel hose is 

removed from its holster, transitions to the Delivering state, where is ready to 
deliver fuel. Activating the trigger on the nozzle causes fuel to be pumped; this 
stops when the trigger is released (for simplicity, I have ignored the pressure 

switch that is designed to stop fuel spillage).Cardinserted
