˜ Figure 23.13 shows how the cost driver attributes influence effort estimates. 
Assume that the exponent value is 1.17 as discussed in the above example. Reliability (RELY), complexity (CPLX), storage (STOR), tools (TOOL), and schedule (SCED) are the key cost drivers in the project. All of the other cost drivers have a nominal value of 1, so they do not affect the effort computation.In Figure 23.13, I have assigned maximum and minimum values to the key cost 
drivers to show how they influence the effort estimate. The values used are those 

from the COCOMO II reference manual (Abts et al. 2000). You can see that high 

values for the cost drivers lead an effort estimate that is more than three times the 

initial estimate, whereas low values reduce the estimate to about one third of the 

original. This highlights the significant differences between different types of 

project and the difficulties of transferring experience from one application domain 

to another.˘˘As well as estimating the overall costs of a project and the effort that is required to 
develop a software system, project managers must also estimate how long the soft-
ware will take to develop and when staff will be needed to work on the project. 

Increasingly, organizations are demanding shorter development schedules so that 

their products can be brought to market before their competitor™s.Exponent value1.17System size (including factors for reuse and
