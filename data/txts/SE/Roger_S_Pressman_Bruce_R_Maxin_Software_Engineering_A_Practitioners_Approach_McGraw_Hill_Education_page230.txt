MODELINGlarge number of classes are derived. Some focus on the game environment—the visual scenes that the user sees as the game is played. Classes such as  Tree, 
Landscape, Road, Wall, Bridge, Building,
 
 and  
VisualEffect
 
 might fall within this 
category.  
Others focus on the characters within the game, describing their phys-ical features, actions, and constraints. Classes such as  Player 
 (described earlier), 
 Protagonist, Antagonist, 
 and  
SupportingRoles 
 might be deﬁ
 ned. Still others 
 describe the rules of the game—how a player navigates through the environ-ment. Classes such as  RulesOfMovement 
 and  
ConstraintsOnAction 
 are candi-
dates here. Many other categories might exist. These classes can be represented 
as analysis classes as shown in  Figure 10.7 .   The plus sign preceding the analysis class name in each package indicates that the classes have public visibility and are therefore accessible from other 
packages. Although they are not shown in the ﬁ gure, other symbols can precede 
an element within a package. A minus sign indicates that an element is hidden 
from all other packages and a # symbol indicates that an element is accessible 
only to packages contained within a given package.

UMMARY  
Class-based modeling uses information derived from use cases and other writ-ten application descriptions to identify analysis classes. A grammatical parse 
may be used to extract candidate classes, attributes, and operations from text-
based narratives. Criteria for the deﬁ nition of a class are deﬁ
 ned. 
 A set of class-responsibility-collaborator index cards can be used to deﬁ ne 
relationships between classes. In addition, a variety of UML modeling notation 
can be applied to deﬁ ne hierarchies, relationships, associations, aggregations,
