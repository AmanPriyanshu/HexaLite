QUALITY MANAGEMENTbackground and are completely unaware of the need for conﬁ guration manage-
ment. As a consequence, the application grows and changes in an uncontrolled 
fashion.   
 
Scalability.   The techniques and controls applied to a small WebApp do not scale 
upward well. It is not uncommon for a simple WebApp to grow signiﬁ
 cantly as in-
terconnections with existing information systems, databases, data warehouses, 
and portal gateways are implemented. As size and complexity grow, small 

changes can have far-reaching and unintended effects that can be problematic. 

Therefore, the rigor of conﬁ guration control mechanisms should be directly pro-
portional to application scale.   
 
 
 
Politics.   Who “owns” a WebApp? This question is argued in companies large and 
small, and its answer has a signiﬁ cant impact on the management and control 
activities. The following questions [Dar99] help a software team understand the 
politics associated with Web engineering: Who assumes responsibility for the ac-

curacy of the information on the website? Who ensures that quality control pro-
cesses have been followed before information is published to the site? Who is 
responsible for making changes? Who assumes the cost of change? The answers 
to these questions help determine the people within an organization who must 
adopt a conﬁ guration management process for WebApps. 
 SCM techniques for MobileApps adopt many of the same principles that are applied for agile software development. In addition to the conventional SCM 
tasks discussed earlier in this chapter, change management for MobileApps 

must also consider the security implications of every change and its impact on a 
broad user base operating in a diverse platform environment.  The dramatic growth of app stores has changed the manner in which mo-bile software is deployed. Changes to a speciﬁ c application can be promulgated 
widely in a matter of days, thereby requiring very careful analysis of impact 
across platforms before a new version of a MobileApp is placed in an app store 
for deployment.  In many instances, a conventional SCM process may be too cumbersome for WebApps and some MobileApps, but a new generation of  
content management tools 
 that are speciﬁ
 cally designed for these application areas have emerged 
over the past decade. These tools establish a process that acquires existing in-
formation (content objects), manages changes to the objects, structures it in a 
way that enables it to be presented to an end user, and then provides it to the 

client-side environment for display.

Conﬁ guration Objects 
 
Web and MobileApps encompass a broad range of conﬁ
 guration objects—content 
objects (e.g., text, graphics, images, video, audio), functional components (e.g., 
scripts, applets), and interface objects (e.g., COM or CORBA for WebApps).
