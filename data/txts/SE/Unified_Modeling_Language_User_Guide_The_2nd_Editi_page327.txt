 Terms and Concepts A component diagram shows a set of components and their relationships. Graphically, a component diagram is a collection of vertices and arcs. Common Properties The general properties of diagrams are discussed in Chapter 7. A component diagram is just a special kind of diagram and shares the same common properties as do all other diagrams#a name and graphical contents that are a projection into a model. What distinguishes a component diagram from all other kinds of diagrams is its particular content. Contents Components are discussed in Chapter 25; interfaces are discussed in Chapter 11; relationships are discussed in Chapters 5 and 10; packages are discussed in Chapter 12; subsystems are discussed in Chapter 31; instances are discussed in Chapter 13; class diagrams are discussed in Chapter 8. Component diagrams commonly contain · Components · Interfaces · Dependency, generalization, association, and realization relationships Like all other diagrams, component diagrams may contain notes and constraints. Component diagrams may also contain packages or subsystems, both of which are used to group elements of your model into larger chunks. Sometimes, you'll want to place instances in your component diagrams, as well, especially when you want to visualize one instance of a family of component-based systems.
