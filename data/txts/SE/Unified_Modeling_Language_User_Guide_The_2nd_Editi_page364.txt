library  component Specifies a static or dynamic object library local  link end Specifies that the corresponding object is visible because it is in a local scope metaclass  classifier Specifies a classifier whose objects are all classes model  package Specifies a semantically closed abstraction of a system parameter  link end Specifies that the corresponding object is visible because it is a parameter postcondition  constraint Specifies a constraint that must hold after the invocation of an operation powertype  class dependency Specifies a classifier whose objects are all the children of a given parent; specifies that the target is a power type of the source precondition  constraint Specifies a constraint that must hold before the invocation of an operation process  class Specifies a classifier whose instances represent a heavyweight flow refine  dependency Specifies that the source is at a finer degree of abstraction than the target requirement  comment Specifies a desired feature, property, or behavior of a system responsibility  comment Specifies a contract by or an obligation of the class self  link end Specifies that the corresponding object is visible because it is the dispatcher of the message send  dependency Specifies that the source operation sends the target event signal  class Specifies an asynchronous stimulus communicated among instances stereotype  class Specifies that the classifier is a stereotype that may be applied to other elements stub  package Specifies a package that serves as a proxy for the public contents of another package subsystem  package Specifies a grouping of elements of which some constitute a specification of the behavior offered by the other contained elements system  package Specifies a package representing the entire system being modeled table  component Specifies a component that represents a database table
