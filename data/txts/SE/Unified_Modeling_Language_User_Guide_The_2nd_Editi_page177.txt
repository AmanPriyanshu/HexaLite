Links Associations are discussed in Chapters 5 and 10. A link is a semantic connection among objects. In general, a link is an instance of an association. As Figure 15-2 shows, wherever a class has an association to another class, there may be a link between the instances of the two classes; wherever there is a link between two objects, one object can send a message to the other object. Figure 15-2 Links and Associations  Stereotypes are discussed in Chapter 6; Appendix B summarizes the UML's standard elements; examples of these stereotypes are discussed in Chapter 18. A link specifies a path along which one object can dispatch a message to another (or the same) object. Most of the time, it is sufficient to specify that such a path exists. If you need to be more precise about how that path exists, you can adorn the appropriate end of the link with any of the following standard stereotypes. $ association  Specifies that the corresponding object is visible by association $ self  Specifies that the corresponding object is visible because it is the dispatcher of the operation $ global  Specifies that the corresponding object is visible because it is in an enclosing scope $ local  Specifies that the corresponding object is visible because it is in a local scope $ parameter  Specifies that the corresponding object is visible because it is a parameter Note As an instance of an association, a link may be rendered with most of the adornments appropriate to associations, such as a name, association role name, navigation, and aggregation. Multiplicity, however, does not apply to links, since they are instances of an association.
