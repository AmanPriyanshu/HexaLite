a framework that emphasizes short-term goals that have a product orientation.

Because software engineers have a good sense of where the process is 
weak, process changes should generally be driven by their needs and 

should start form the bottom up. 
 Conradi and Fuggetta [Con02] suggest that future SPI activities should “use a simple and focused scorecard to 
start with, not a large assessment.” By focusing SPI efforts narrowly and 
working from the bottom up, practitioners will begin to see substantive 
changes early—changes that make a real difference in the way that soft-
ware engineering work is conducted.

Automated software process technology (SPT) will move away from global 
process management (broad-based support of the entire software process) 

to focus on those aspects of the software process that can best beneﬁ
 t 
from automation.
 
 No one is against tools and automation, but in many instances, SPT has not met its promise (see Section 38.3). To be most ef-

fective, it should focus on umbrella activities (Chapter 3)—the most stable 
elements of the software process.

Greater emphasis will be placed on the return on investment of SPI activ-
ities. 
 In Chapter 37, you learned that return on investment (ROI) can be deﬁ ned as: 
   
ROI 5   o( beneﬁ ts
 
2o( costs 
)   ______________________  o( costs 
)   3 100%  
  
  To date, software organizations have struggled to clearly delineate “bene-
ﬁ ts” in a quantitative manner. It can be argued [Con02] that “we therefore 

provement initiatives.”

As time passes, the software community may come to understand that 
expertise in sociology and anthropology may have as much or more to do 

with successful SPI as other, more technical disciplines.
 
 Above all else, SPI changes organizational culture, and cultural change involves individuals 
and groups of people. Conradi and Fuggetta [Con02] correctly note that 
“software developers are knowledge workers. They tend to respond nega-
tively to top-level dictates on how to do work or change processes.” Much 
can be learned by examining the sociology of groups to better understand 
effective ways to introduce change.

New modes of learning may facilitate the transition to a more effective soft-
ware process.
 
 In this context, “learning” implies learning from successes and mistakes. A software organization that collects metrics (Chapters 30 
and 32) allows itself to understand how elements of a process affect the 
quality of the end product.  pre22126_ch38_839-859.indd   850pre22126_ch38_839-859.indd   85013/12/13   6:17 PM13/12/13   6:17 PM
