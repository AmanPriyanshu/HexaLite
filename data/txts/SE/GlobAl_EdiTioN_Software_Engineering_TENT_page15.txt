PARTMy aim in this part of the book is to provide a general introduction to soft-ware engineering. The chapters in this part have been designed to support 

a one-semester first course in software engineering. I introduce impor
-tant concepts such as software processes and agile methods, and describe 
essential software development activities, from requirements specification 
through to system evolution.Chapter 1 is a general introduction that introduces professional software 

engineering and defines some software engineering concepts. I have also 

included a brief discussion of ethical issues in software engineering. It is 

important for software engineers to think about the wider implications of 

their work. This chapter also introduces four case studies that I use in the 

book. These are an information system for managing records of patients 

undergoing treatment for mental health problems (Mentcare), a control 
system for a portable insulin pump, an embedded system for a wilder
-
ness weather station and a digital learning environment (iLearn).
Chapters 2 and 3 cover software engineering processes and agile devel
-opment. In Chapter 2, I introduce software process models, such as the 

waterfall model, and I discuss the basic activities that are part of these 

processes. Chapter 3 supplements this with a discussion of agile devel
-
opment methods for software engineering. This chapter had been
