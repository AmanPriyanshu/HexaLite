radio so that information is delivered as a signal on a specific radio channel. 
The car is equipped with GPS receiver to discover its position, and, based on 

that position, the system accesses a range of information services. Information 

may then be delivered in the driver™s specified language.
Figure 18.
1 illustrates a possible organization for such a system. The in-car soft
-ware includes five modules. These handle communications with the driver, with a 
GPS receiver that reports the car™s position, and with the car radio. The 
Transmitter
 and Receiver modules handle all communications with external services.
The car communicates with an external mobile information service that aggre
-gates information from a range of other services, providing information on weather, 

traffic, and local facilities. Different providers in different places offer these services, 

and the in-car system accesses an external discovery service to find the services 

available in the local area. The mobile information service also uses the discovery 

service to bind to the appropriate weather, traffic, and facilities services. The aggre
-
gated information is then sent to the car through a service that translates that infor
-mation into the driver™s preferred language.
This example illustrates one of the key advantages of the service-oriented approach. 
When the system is programmed or deployed, you don™t have to decide what service
