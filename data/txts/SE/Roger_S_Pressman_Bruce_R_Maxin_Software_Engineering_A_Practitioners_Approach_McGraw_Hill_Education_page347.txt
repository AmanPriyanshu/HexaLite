317  We live in a world of high-technology products, and virtually all of them—consumer electronics, industrial equipment, automobiles, 
corporate systems, military systems, personal computer software, mobile apps, and WebApps—require human interaction. If a product is to be 

successful, it must exhibit good  usability 
—a qualitative measure of the ease and efﬁ ciency with which a human can employ the functions and features 
 offered by the high-technology product.  For the ﬁ rst three decades of the computing era, usability was not a dom-
inant concern among those who built software. In his classic book on design, 
Donald Norman [Nor88] argued that it was time for a change in attitude:  To make technology that ﬁ
 ts human beings, it is necessary to study human beings. 
But now we tend to study only the technology. As a result, people are required to 

conform to technology. It is time to reverse this trend, time to make technology 

that conforms to people.  As technologists studied human interaction, two dominant issues arose. 
First, a set of  golden rules 
 (discussed in Section 15.1) were identiﬁ
 ed. These 
applied to all human interaction with technology products. Second, a set 

of  interaction mechanisms 
 were deﬁ
 ned to enable software designers to 
build systems that properly implemented the golden rules. These inter-

action mechanisms, collectively called the user interface, have eliminated 

some of the most egregious problems associated with human interfaces. 

But even today, we all encounter user interfaces that are difﬁ
 cult to learn, 
difﬁ cult to use, confusing, counterintuitive, unforgiving, and in many cases, 
totally frustrating. Yet, someone spent time and energy building each of 

these interfaces, and it is not likely that the builder created these problems 

purposely.

CHAPTER 
QUICK LOOK   
What is it?   
User interface design 
creates an effective communication 
medium between a human and a 
computer. Following a set of inter-
face design principles, design identiﬁ es inter-
face objects and actions and then creates a screen layout that forms the basis for a user 
interface prototype. 
  
 
Who does it?   
A software engineer designs 
the user interface by applying an iterative 

process that draws on predeﬁ ned design 
principles.
