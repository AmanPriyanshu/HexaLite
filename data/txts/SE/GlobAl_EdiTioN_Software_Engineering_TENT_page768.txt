program evolution dynamicsThe study of the ways in which an evolving software system changes. It is claimed that Lehman™s Laws govern the dynamics of program evolution.program generatorA program that generates another program from a high-level, abstract specification. 
The generator embeds knowledge that is reused in each generation activity.program inspectionA review where a group of inspectors examine a program, line by line, with the aim 
of detecting program errors. A checklist of common programming errors often 
drives inspections.PythonA programming language with dynamic types, which is particularly well-suited to 
the development of web-based systems.quality management (QM)The set of processes concerned with defining how software quality can be achieved 
and how the organization developing the software knows that the software has met 
the required level of quality.quality planA plan that defines the quality processes and procedures that should be used. This 
involves selecting and instantiating standards for products and processes and defin-
ing the system quality attributes that are most important.rapid application development (RAD)An approach to software development aimed at rapid delivery of the software. It 
often involves the use of database programming and development support tools 
such as screen and report generators.rate of occurrence of failure (ROCOF)A reliability metric that is based on the number of observed failures of a system in a 
given time period.Rational Unified Process (RUP)A generic software process model that presents software development as a four-
phase iterative activity, where the phases are inception, elaboration, construction 
and transition. Inception establishes a business case for the system, elaboration 
defines the architecture, construction implements the system, and transition deploys 
the system in the customer™s environment.real-time systemA system that has to recognize and process external events in ™real-time™. The 
 correctness of the system does not just depend on what it does but also on how quickly 

it does it. Real-time systems are usually organized as a set of concurrent processes.
