 object (in this case, the client class). The relationship between 
these two objects is not a simple association, yet a dependency association does 
exist. In a use case written for surveillance (not shown), you learn that a special 
password must be provided in order to view speciﬁ c camera locations. One way 
to achieve this is to have  Camera 
 request a password and then grant permission to the  DisplayWindow
 
 to produce the video display. This can be represented as 
shown in  Figure 10.6  where <<access>> implies that the use of the camera output 
is controlled by a special password.

An important part of analysis modeling is categorization. That is, various  elements of the requirements model (e.g., use cases, analysis classes) are categorized in a 
manner that packages them as a grouping—called an  analysis  package 
—that is given a representative name.  To illustrate the use of analysis packages, consider the video game that we 
introduced earlier. As the analysis model for the video game is developed, a 
   A package is used to 
assemble a collection 
of related classes. WallSegment
