example, an actuator may control a valve and change its state from ﬁopenﬂ to 

ﬁclosed.ﬂ The ﬁmasterﬂ process is usually responsible for computation, coordina-tion, and communications, and it controls the ﬁslaveﬂ processes. ﬁSlaveﬂ pro

cesses are dedicated to specific actions, such as the acquisition of data from an 

array of sensors. Figure 17.7 shows an example of this architectural model. A traffic control sys-tem in a city has three logical processes that run on separate processors. The master 
process is the control room process, which communicates with separate slave pro-
cesses that are responsible for collecting traffic data and managing the operation of 
traffic lights.A set of distributed sensors collects information on the traffic flow. The sensor 
control process polls the sensors periodically to capture the traffic flow informa-
tion and collates this information for further processing. The sensor processor is 

itself polled periodically for information by the master process that is concerned 

with displaying traffic status to operators, computing traffic light sequences, and 

accepting operator commands to modify these sequences. The control room sys-
tem sends commands to a traffic light control process that converts these into sig-
nals to control the traffic light hardware. The master control room system is itself 

organized as a clientŒserver system, with the client processes running on the oper-
ator™s consoles.You use this masterŒslave model of a distributed system in situations where you can predict the distributed processing that is required and where processing can be 
easily localized to slave processors. This situation is common in real-time systems, 
where it is important to meet processing deadlines. Slave processors can be used for 
computationally intensive operations, such as signal processing and the management 
of equipment controlled by the system.Traffic lights
