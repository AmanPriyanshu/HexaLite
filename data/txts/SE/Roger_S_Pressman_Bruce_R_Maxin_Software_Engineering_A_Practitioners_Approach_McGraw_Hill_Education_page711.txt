CHAPTER 30  
PRODUCT METRICS 681   
A comprehensive summary of dozens of useful software metrics is presented in [IEE93]. In general, a discussion of each metric has been distilled to the essential “primitives” (mea-
sures) required to compute the metric and the appropriate relationships to effect the com-
putation. An appendix provides discussion and many references.    
Whitmire [Whi97] presents a comprehensive and mathematically sophisticated treat-ment of OO metrics. Lorenz and Kidd [Lor94] and Hendersen-Sellers ( Object-Oriented Met-rics: Measures of Complexity,
  Prentice Hall, 1996) provide treatments that are dedicated to OO metrics.  A wide variety of information sources on software metrics are available on the Internet. An up-to-date list of World Wide Web references that are relevant to software metrics can
