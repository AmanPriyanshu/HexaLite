28 CHAPTER 2  
SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
on Software Engineering,
 
 sponsored by the IEEE and ACM, and is discussed in depth in jour-
nals such as  ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology, ACM Software 
Engineering Notes, 
 and  
Annals of Software Engineering.
 
 Tens of thousands of Web pages are 
dedicated to software engineering and the software process.   
 
Many books addressing the software process and software engineering have been pub-lished in recent years. Some present an overview of the entire process, while others delve 
into a few important topics to the exclusion of others. Among the more popular offerings (in 
addition to this book!) are

, Addison-Wesley, 2010) present a 
broad collection of useful guidelines that are applicable to the deployment activity. 
  
 
Many software engineering standards have been published by the IEEE, ISO, and their standards organizations over the past few decades. Moore ( The Road Map to Software En-
gineering: A Standards-Based Guide,
 
 IEEE Computer Society Press [Wiley], 2006) provides a 
useful survey of relevant standards and how they apply to real projects.   
 
A wide variety of information sources on software engineering and the software process are available on the Internet. An up-to-date list of World Wide Web references that are rel-

evant to the software process can be found at the SEPA website:
