It is ironic that software maintenance and support represent the most costly activities in the 
life of an application, and yet, fewer books have been written about maintenance and support 

than any other major software engineering topics. Among recent additions to the literature 

are books by Reifer ( Software Maintenance Success Recipes,
 
 Auerbach, 2011),  Jarzabek ( Effec-tive Software Maintenance and Evolution,
 
 Auerbach, 2007), Grubb and Takang  
(Software Main-
tenance: Concepts and Practice, 
 World Scientiﬁ
 c Publishing Co., 2nd ed., 2003), and Pigoski 
( Practical Software Maintenance,
 
 Wiley, 1996). These books cover basic maintenance and sup-
port practices and present useful management guidance. Maintenance techniques that focus 

on client-server environments are discussed by Schneberger ( Client/Server Software Mainte-
nance, 
 McGraw-Hill, 1997). Current research in “software evolution” is presented in an anthol-
ogy edited by Mens and Demeyer ( Software Evolution,
 
 Springer, 2008). 
 Like many hot topics in the business community, the hype surrounding business process 
reengineering has given way to a more pragmatic view of the subject. Hammer and Champy 
( Reengineering the Corporation 
, HarperBusiness, revised edition, 2003) precipitated early interest with their best-selling book. Other books by Jacka and Keller ( Business Process 
Mapping: Improving Customer Satisfaction,
 
 2nd ed., Wiley, 2009), Sharp and  
McDermott ( Workﬂ
 ow Modeling,
 
 2nd ed., Artech House, 2008), Andersen ( 
Business Process Improve-
ment Toolbox,
 
 2nd  
 
ed.,   
American Society for Quality, 2007), Smith and Fingar [ 
Business Process Management (BPM): The Third Wave,
 
 Meghan-Kiffer Press, 2003], and Harrington 
al. ( 
Business Process Improvement Workbook,
 
 McGraw-Hill, 1997) present case studies 
and  detailed guidelines for BPR.  Abfalter ( Software Reengineering,
 
 VDM Verlag, 2008), Fong ( 
Information Systems Reengi-neering and Integration, 
 Springer, 2006) describes database conversion techniques, reverse 
engineering, and forward engineering as they are applied for major information systems. 
Nierstrasz and his colleagues ( Object Oriented Reengineering Patterns, 
 Square Bracket As-sociates, 2009) provides a patterns-based view of how to refactor and/or reengineer OO 
systems. Secord and his colleagues ( Modernizing Legacy Systems, 
 Addison-Wesley, 2003), 
Ulrich ( Legacy Systems: Transformation Strategies,
 
 Prentice Hall, 2002), Valenti ( 
Successful Software Reengineering,
 
 IRM Press, 2002), and Rada ( 
Reengineering Software: How to Reuse 
Programming to Build New, State-of-the-Art Software,
 
 Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, 1999) 
focus on strategies and practices for reengineering at a technical level. Miller ( Reengineer-
ing Legacy Software Systems,
 
 Digital Press, 1998) “provides a framework for keeping appli-
cation systems synchronized with business strategies and technology changes.”  Cameron ( Reengineering Business for Success in the Internet Age, 
 Computer Technology 
Research, 2000) and Umar ( Application (Re)Engineering: Building Web-Based Applications 
and Dealing with Legacies, 
 Prentice Hall, 1997) provide worthwhile guidance for organiza-
tions that want to transform legacy systems into a Web-based environment. Cook ( 
Building 
Enterprise Information Architectures: Reengineering Information Systems,
 
 Prentice Hall, 1996) 
discusses the bridge between BPR and information technology. Aiken ( 
Data Reverse Engi-neering, 
 McGraw-Hill, 1996) discusses how to reclaim, reorganize, and reuse organizational 
data. Arnold ( Software Reengineering,
 
 IEEE Computer Society Press, 1993) has put together 
an excellent anthology of early papers that focus on software reengineering technologies. 
 A wide variety of information sources on software reengineering is available on the In-ternet. An up-to-date list of World Wide Web references can be found under “software engi-

neering resources” at the SEPA website:
