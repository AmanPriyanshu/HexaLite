CHAPTER 37  
SOFTWARE PROCESS IMPROVEMENT
 835 
At a qualitative level, proponents of SPI argue that an improved software pro-cess will lead to improved software quality. They contend that improved process 

will result in the implementation of better-quality ﬁ
 lters (resulting in fewer prop-
agated defects), better control of change (resulting in less project chaos), and 
less technical rework (resulting in lower cost and better time-to-market). But 
can these qualitative beneﬁ ts be translated into quantitative results? The classic 
return on investment (ROI) equation is:  
ROI 5  [  
 [S ( beneﬁ ts
 
) 2 S ( costs 
)]   ________________________  S ( costs 
)   ]

  where  
 
 
 
 
beneﬁ ts
 
 include the cost savings associated with higher product quality (fewer defects), less rework, reduced effort associated with changes, and the in-
come that accrues from shorter time-to-market.    
 
 
 
costs 
 include both direct SPI costs (e.g., training, measurement) and indirect costs associated with greater emphasis on quality control and change manage-
ment activities and more rigorous application of software engineering methods 
(e.g., the creation of a design model).  
 
  In the real world, these quantitative beneﬁ ts and costs are sometimes difﬁ
 cult 
to measure with accuracy, and all are open to interpretation. But that doesn’t 

mean that a software organization should conduct an SPI program without care-
ful analysis of the costs and beneﬁ ts that accrue. A comprehensive treatment of 
ROI for SPI can be found in a unique book by David Rico [Ric04].

SPI TRENDS  
 
Over the past 25 years, many companies have attempted to improve their soft-ware engineering practices by applying an SPI framework to effect organiza-
tional change and technology transition. As we noted earlier in this chapter, over 

half fail in this endeavor. Regardless of success or failure, all spend signiﬁ
 cant 
amounts of money. David Rico [Ric04] reports that a typical application of an SPI 

framework such as the SEI CMM can cost between $25,000 and $70,000 per per-

son and take years to complete! It should come as no surprise that the future of 
SPI should emphasize a less costly and time-consuming approach.  To be effective in the twenty-ﬁ
 rst-century world of software development, fu-
ture SPI frameworks must become signiﬁ cantly more agile. Rather than an orga-
nizational focus (which can take years to complete successfully), contemporary 
SPI efforts should focus on the project level, working to improve a team process 
in weeks, not months or years. To achieve meaningful results (even at the project 

level) in a short time frame, complex framework models may give way to simpler 
models. Rather than dozens of key practices and hundreds of supplementary pre22126_ch37_817-838.indd   835pre22126_ch37_817-838.indd   83513/12/13   6:17 PM13/12/13   6:17 PM
