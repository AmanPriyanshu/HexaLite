˜Experienced engineers, working with domain experts and professional safety 
advisers, identify hazards from previous experience and from an analysis of the appli-cation domain. Group working techniques such as brainstorming may be used, where 

a group meets to exchange ideas. For the insulin pump system, people who may be 

involved include doctors, medical physicists and engineers, and software designers.The insulin pump system that I introduced in Chapter 1 is a safety-critical system, because failure can cause injury or even death to the system user. Accidents that may 
occur when using this machine include the user suffering from long-term conse
-
quences of poor blood sugar control (eye, heart, and kidney problems), cognitive 

dysfunction as a result of low blood sugar levels, or the occurrence of some other 
medical conditions, such as an allergic reaction.Some of the hazards that may arise in the insulin pump system are:˜ insulin overdose computation (service failure);˜ insulin underdose computation (service failure);˜ failure of the hardware monitoring system (service failure);˜ power failure due to exhausted battery (electrical);˜ electrical interference with other medical equipment such as a heart pacemaker 

(electrical);˜ poor sensor and actuator contact caused by incorrect fitting (physical);˜ parts of machine breaking off in patient™s body (physical);˜ infection caused by introduction of machine (biological); and˜ allergic reaction to the materials or insulin used in the machine (biological).Software-related hazards are normally concerned with failure to deliver a system 
service or with the failure of monitoring and protection systems. Monitoring and 
protection systems may be included in a device to detect conditions, such as a low 
battery level, which could lead to device failure.A hazard register may be used to record the identified hazards with an explanation of 
why the hazard has been included. The hazard register is an important legal document 

that records all safety-related decisions about each hazard. It can be used to show that 

the requirements engineers have paid due care and attention in considering all foresee-
able hazards and that these hazards have been analyzed. In the event of an accident, the 

hazard register may be used in a subsequent inquiry or legal proceedings to show that 

the system developers have not been negligent in their system safety analysis.ˇˇThe hazard assessment process focuses on understanding the factors that lead to the 

occurrence of a hazard and the consequences if an accident or incident associated 

with that hazard should occur. You need to carry out this analysis to understand
