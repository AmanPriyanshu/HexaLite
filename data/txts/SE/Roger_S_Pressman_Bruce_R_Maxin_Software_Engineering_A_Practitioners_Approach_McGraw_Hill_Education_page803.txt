CHAPTER 34  
PROJECT SCHEDULING 773 
Stated even more simply, earned value is a measure of progress. It enables 
you to assess the “percent of completeness” of a project using quantitative anal-
ysis rather than rely on a gut feeling. In fact, Fleming and Koppleman [Fle98] 
argue that earned value analysis “provides accurate and reliable readings of per-

formance from as early as 15 percent into the project.” To determine the earned 

value, the following steps are performed:  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 1.
  The  budgeted cost of work scheduled 
 (BCWS) is determined for each work task represented in the schedule. During estimation, the work (in 
person-hours or person-days) of each software engineering task is 
planned. Hence, BCWS i  is the effort planned for work task  i. 
 To determine 
progress at a given point along the project schedule, the value of BCWS is 
the sum of the BCWS i  values for all work tasks that should have been completed by that point in time on the project schedule.   
 
 
 2.
  The BCWS values for all work tasks are summed to derive the  budget at completion 
 (BAC). Hence,   
 
BAC 5 S (BCWS k 
) for all tasks  k 
 
  
 
 
 3.
  Next, the value for  budgeted cost of work performed 
 (BCWP) is computed. The value for BCWP is the sum of the BCWS values for all work tasks that 
have actually been completed by a point in time on the project schedule.  
 
   
 
 
 
 
Wilkens [Wil99] notes that “the distinction between the BCWS and the BCWP 
is that the former represents the budget of the activities that were planned to 
be completed and the latter represents the budget of the activities that actually 
were completed.” Given values for BCWS, BAC, and BCWP, important progress 

indicators can be computed:Schedule performance index, SPI 5   BCWP _______ BCWS  Schedule variance, SV 5 BCWP 2 BCWS  SPI is an indication of the efﬁ ciency with which the project is utilizing sched-
uled resources. An SPI value close to 1.0 indicates efﬁ cient execution of the proj-
ect schedule. SV is simply an absolute indication of variance from the planned 
schedule.Percent scheduled for completion 5   BCWS _______ BAC    provides an indication of the percentage of work that should have been com-pleted by time  t. Percent complete 5   BCWP _______ BAC    provides a quantitative indication of the percent of completeness of the project at a given point in time  t.
