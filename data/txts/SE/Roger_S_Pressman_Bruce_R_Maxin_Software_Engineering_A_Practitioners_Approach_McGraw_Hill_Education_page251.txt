REQUIREMENTS MODELING: BEHAVIOR, PATTERNS, AND WEB/MOBILE APPS
 221of navigation are deﬁ ned as part of design. At this stage, you should focus on overall 
navigation requirements. The following questions should be considered:  
 
 
•  Should certain elements be easier to reach (require fewer navigation steps) than others? What is the priority for presentation?   
 
 
•  Should certain elements be emphasized to force users to navigate in their direction?   
 
 
•  How should navigation errors be handled?   
 
 
•  Should navigation to related groups of elements be given priority over navigation to a speciﬁ c element? 
  
 
 
•  Should navigation be accomplished via links, via search-based access, or by some other means?   
 
 
•  Should certain elements be presented to users based on the context of previous navigation actions?   
 
 
•  Should a navigation log be maintained for users?   
 
 
•  Should a full navigation map or menu (as opposed to a single “back” link or directed pointer) be available at every point in a user’s interaction? 
  
 
 
•  Should navigation design be driven by the most commonly expected user behaviors or by the perceived importance of the deﬁ ned WebApp 
elements?   
 
 
•  Can a user “store” his previous navigation through the WebApp to expe-
dite future usage?   
 
 
•  For which user category should optimal navigation be designed?   
 
 
•  How should links external to the WebApp be handled? Overlaying the 
existing browser window? As a new browser window? As a separate frame? 
 
 
  These and many other questions should be asked and answered as part of navigation analysis.  You and other stakeholders must also determine overall requirements for 
navigation. For example, will a “site map” be provided to give users an overview 
of the entire WebApp structure? Can a user take a “guided tour” that will high-

light the most important elements (content objects and functions) that are avail-
able? Will a user be able to access content objects or functions based on deﬁ
 ned 
attributes of those elements (e.g., a user might want to access all photographs of 
a speciﬁ c building or all functions that allow computation of weight)?

Behavioral modeling during requirements analysis depicts dynamic behavior of the software. The behavioral model uses input from scenario-based or class-
based elements to represent the states of analysis classes and the system as a pre22126_ch11_202-223.indd   221pre22126_ch11_202-223.indd   22113/12/13   6:12 PM13/12/13   6:12 PM
