The inheritance of the implementation of a more specific element; also includes inheritance of the interface.  implementation view  The view of a system's architecture that encompasses the components used to assemble and release the physical system; an implementation view addresses the configuration management of the system's releases, made up of somewhat independent components that can be assembled in various ways to produce a running system.  import  In the context of packages, a dependency that shows the package whose classes may be referenced within a given package (including packages recursively embedded within it).  inception  The first phase of the software development life cycle, in which the seed idea for the development is brought to the point of being sufficiently well-founded to warrant entering into the elaboration phase.  incomplete  Modeling an element with certain of its parts missing.  inconsistent  Modeling an element for which the integrity of the model is not guaranteed.  incremental  In the context of the software development life cycle, a process that involves the continuous integration of the system's architecture to produce releases, with each new release embodying incremental improvements over the other.  inheritance  The mechanism by which more-specific elements incorporate the structure and behavior or more-general elements.  instance  A concrete manifestation of an abstraction; an entity to which a set of operations can be applied and that has a state that stores the effects of the operations.  integrity
