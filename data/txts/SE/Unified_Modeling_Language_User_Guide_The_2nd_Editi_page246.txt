2. Event trigger  The event whose reception by the object in the source state makes the transition eligible to fire, providing its guard condition is satisfied 3. Guard condition  A Boolean expression that is evaluated when the transition is triggered by the reception of the event trigger; if the expression evaluates True, the transition is eligible to fire; if the expression evaluates False, the transition does not fire and if there is no other transition that could be triggered by that same event, the event is lost 4. Action  An executable atomic computation that may directly act on the object that owns the state machine, and indirectly on other objects that are visible to the object 5. Target state  The state that is active after the completion of the transition Forking andjoining are also discussed in Chapter 19. As Figure 21-3 shows, a transition is rendered as a solid directed line from the source to the target state. A self-transition is a transition whose source and target states are the same. Figure 21-3 Transitions  Note A transition may have multiple sources (in which case, it represents a join from multiple concurrent states) as well as multiple targets (in which case, it represents a fork to multiple concurrent states).  Events are discussed in Chapter 20. Event Trigger   An event is the specification of a significant occurrence that has a location in time and space. In the context of state machines, an event is an occurrence of a stimulus that can trigger a state transition. As shown in the previous figure, events may include signals, calls, the passing of time,
