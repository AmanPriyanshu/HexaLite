xxx PREFACE

In addition, we’d like to thank Austin Krauss, Senior Software Engineer at Treyarch, 
for providing insight into software development in the video game industry. We also 
wish to thank the reviewers of the eighth edition: Manuel E. Bermudez, University of 
Florida; Scott DeLoach, Kansas State University; Alex Liu, Michigan State University; 
and Dean Mathias, Utah State University. Their in-depth comments and thoughtful 
criticism have helped us make this a much better book.  
  
Special Thanks.   BRM: I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work with Roger on the eighth edition of this book. During the time I have been working on this book 
my son Benjamin shipped his ﬁ rst MobileApp and my daughter Katherine launched 

her interior design career. I am quite pleased to see the adults they have become. 
am very grateful to my wife, Norma, for the enthusiastic support she has given me as 

I ﬁ lled my free time with working on this book. 
 RSP: As the editions of this book have evolved, my sons, Mathew and Michael, have grown from boys to men. Their maturity, character, and success in the real world 
have been an inspiration to me. Nothing has ﬁ lled me with more pride. They now have 

children of their own, Maya and Lily, who start still another generation. Both girls are 
already wizards on mobile computing devices. Finally, to my wife Barbara, my love 
and thanks for tolerating the many, many hours in the ofﬁ ce and encouraging still 
another edition of “the book.”
