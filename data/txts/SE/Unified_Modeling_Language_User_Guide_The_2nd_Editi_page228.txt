· Identify the preconditions of the workflow's initial state and the postconditions of the workflow's final state. This is important in helping you model the boundaries of the workflow. · Beginning at the workflow's initial state, specify the activities and actions that take place over time and render them in the activity diagram as either activity states or action states. · For complicated actions, or for sets of actions that appear multiple times, collapse these into activity states, and provide a separate activity diagram that expands on each. · Render the transitions that connect these activity and action states. Start with the sequential flows in the workflow first, next consider branching, and only then consider forking and joining. · If there are important objects that are involved in the workflow, render them in the activity diagram, as well. Show their changing values and state as necessary to communicate the intent of the object flow. For example, Figure 19-9 shows an activity diagram for a retail business, which specifies the workflow involved when a customer returns an item from a mail order. Work starts with the Customer action Request return and then flows through Telesales (Get return number), back to the Customer (Ship item), then to the Warehouse (Receive item then Restock item), finally ending in Accounting (Credit account). As the diagram indicates, one significant object (i, an instance of Item) also flows the process, changing from the returned to the available state. Figure 19-9 Modeling a Workflow  Note
