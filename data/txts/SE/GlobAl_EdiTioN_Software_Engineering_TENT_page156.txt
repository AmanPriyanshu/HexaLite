˚˛˝˙ˆˇ˘˜˜˜˜˜˜ˇˇEvent-driven modeling shows how a system responds to external and internal 
events. It is based on the assumption that a system has a finite number of states 

and that events (stimuli) may cause a transition from one state to another. For 

example, a system controlling a valve may move from a state ﬁValve openﬂ to a 

state ﬁValve closedﬂ when an operator command (the stimulus) is received. This 

view of a system is particularly appropriate for real-time systems. Event-driven 

modeling is used extensively when designing and documenting real-time systems 

(Chapter 21).The UML supports event-based modeling using state diagrams, which are based on Statecharts (Harel 1987). State diagrams show system states and events that cause 
transitions from one state to another. They do not show the flow of data within the 
system but may include additional information on the computations carried out in 

each state.I use an example of control software for a very simple microwave oven to illus-trate event-driven modeling (Figure 5.16). Real microwave ovens are much more 

complex than this system, but the simplified system is easier to understand. This 

simple oven has a switch to select full or half power, a numeric keypad to input the 
cooking time, a start/stop button, and an alphanumeric display.Full po
