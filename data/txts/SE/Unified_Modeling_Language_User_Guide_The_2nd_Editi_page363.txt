executable component Specifies a component that may be executed on a node extend  dependency Specifies that the target use case extends the behavior of the source use case at the given extension point facade  package Specifies a package that is only a view on some other package file  component Specifies a component that represents a document containing source code or data framework  package Specifies a package consisting mainly of patterns friend  dependency Specifies that the source is given special visibility into the target global  link end Specifies that the corresponding object is visible because it is in an enclosing scope import  dependency Specifies that the public contents of the target package enter the flat namespace of the source, as if they had been declared in the source implementation  generalization Specifies that the child inherits the implementation of the parent but does not make public nor support its interfaces, thereby violating substitutability implementa tionClass  class Specifies the implementation of a class in some programming language include  dependency Specifies that the source use case explicitly incorporates the behavior of another use case at a location spec ified by the source instanceOf  dependency Specifies that the source object is an instance of the target classifier instantiate  dependency Specifies that operations on the source class create instances of the target class interface  class Specifies a collection of operations that are used to specify a service of a class or a component invariant  constraint Specifies a constraint that must always hold for the associated element
