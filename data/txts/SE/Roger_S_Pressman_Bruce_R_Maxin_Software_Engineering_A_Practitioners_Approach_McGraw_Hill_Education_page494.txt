464 PART THREE  
QUALITY MANAGEMENTmanagement, procedures for assuring compliance to standards, and measure-ment and reporting mechanisms.  To properly conduct software quality assurance, data about the software en-
gineering process should be collected, evaluated, and disseminated. Statistical 
SQA helps to improve the quality of the product and the software process it-
self. Software reliability models extend measurements, enabling collected defect 
data to be extrapolated into projected failure rates and reliability predictions.  In summary, you should note the words of Dunn and Ullman [Dun82]: “Soft-
ware quality assurance is the mapping of the managerial precepts and design 
disciplines of quality assurance onto the applicable managerial and technolog-
ical space of software engineering.” The ability to ensure quality is the measure 
of a mature engineering discipline. When the mapping is successfully accom-
plished, mature software engineering is the result.

ROBLEMS AND POINTS TO PONDER  
 
 
 
21.1.  Some people say that “variation control is the heart of quality control.” Since every program that is created is different from every other program, what are the variations that 
we look for and how do we control them?    
 
21.2.  Is it possible to assess the quality of software if the customer keeps changing what it is supposed to do?    
 
21.3.  Quality and reliability are related concepts but are fundamentally different in a num-ber of ways. Discuss the differences.    
 
21.4.  Can a program be correct and still not be reliable? Explain.    
 
21.5.  Can a program be correct and still not exhibit good quality? Explain.    
 
21.6.  Why is there often tension between a software engineering group and an independent software quality assurance group? Is this healthy?    
 
21.7.  You have been given the responsibility for improving the quality of software across 
your organization. What is the ﬁ rst thing that you should do? What’s next? 
   
 
21.8.  Besides counting errors and defects, are there other countable characteristics of soft-ware that imply quality? What are they and can they be measured directly?    
 
21.9.  The MTBF concept for software is open to criticism. Explain why. 
   
 
21.10.  Consider two safety-critical systems that are controlled by computer. List at least 
three hazards for each that can be directly linked to software failures.    
 
21.11.  Acquire a copy of ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 9000-3. Prepare a presentation that dis-cusses three ISO 9001 requirements and how they apply in a software context.
