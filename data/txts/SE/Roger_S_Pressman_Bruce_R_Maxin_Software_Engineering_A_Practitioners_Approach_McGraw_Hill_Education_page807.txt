777 RISKMANAGEMENT  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In his book on risk analysis and management, Robert Charette [Cha89] presents a conceptual deﬁ nition of risk: 
 
 
First, risk concerns future happenings. Today and yesterday are beyond active 
concern, as we are already reaping what was previously sowed by our past ac-
tions. The question is, can we, therefore, by changing our actions today, create an 

opportunity for a different and hopefully better situation for ourselves tomorrow. 

This means, second, that risk involves change, such as in changes of mind, opin-
[Third,] risk involves choice, and the uncertainty that 

choice itself entails. Thus paradoxically, risk, like death and taxes, is one of the 

few certainties of life.  
  
When you consider risk in the context of software engineering, Charette’s 
three conceptual underpinnings are always in evidence. The future is your 
concern—what risks might cause the software project to go awry? Change 
is your concern—how will changes in customer requirements, development KEY CONCEPTS     assessment. . . . . . 781

CHAPTER35  
 
What is it?   Risk analysis and man-agement are a series of steps that 

help a software team understand and 

manage uncertainty. Many problems 
can plague a software project. A risk is a poten-
tial problem—it might happen, it might not. But, 

regardless of the outcome, it’s a really good idea 

to identify it, assess its probability of occurrence, 

estimate its impact, and establish a contingency 

plan should the problem actually occur. 
  
 
Who does it?   Everyone involved in the soft-
ware process—managers, software engineers, 
and other stakeholders—participate in risk 

analysis and management.   
 
Why is it important? 
  Think about the Boy Scout motto: “Be prepared.” Software is a dif-
ﬁ cult undertaking. Lots of things can go wrong, 
and frankly, many often do. It’s for this rea-

son that being prepared—understanding the 
risks and taking proactive measures to avoid 
or manage them—is a key element of good 
software project management.   
 
What are the steps?   Recognizing what can go wrong is the ﬁ rst step, called “risk identi-
ﬁ cation.” Next, each risk is analyzed to de-
termine the likelihood that it will occur and 

the damage that it will do if it does occur. 

Once this information is established, risks are 

ranked, by probability and impact. Finally, a 

plan is developed to manage those risks that 
have high probability and high impact.   
 
What is the work product? 
  A risk mitiga-tion, monitoring, and management (RMMM) 
plan or a set of risk information sheets is 

produced.   
 
How do I ensure that I’ve done it right?   The risks that are analyzed and managed should be derived from a thorough study of 
the people, the product, the process, and the 
project. The RMMM should be revisited as the 
project proceeds to ensure that risks are kept 
up to date. Contingency plans for risk manage-
ment should be realistic.
