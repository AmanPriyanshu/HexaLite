 You can specify other features of an operation, such as marking it polymorphic or constant, or specifying its visibility, as discussed in Chapter 9. You can specify an operation by stating its signature, covering the name, type, and default value of all parameters and (in the case of functions) a return type, as shown in Figure 4-6. Figure 4-6 Operations and Their Signatures  Organizing Attributes and Operations When drawing a class, you don't have to show every attribute and every operation at once. In fact, in most cases, you can't (there are too many of them to put in one figure) and you probably shouldn't (only a subset of these attributes and operations are likely to be relevant to a specific view). For these reasons, you can elide a class, meaning that you can choose to show only some or none of a class's attributes and operations. An empty compartment doesn't necessarily mean there are no attributes or operations, just that you didn't choose to show them. You can explicitly specify that there are more attributes or properties than shown by ending each list with an ellipsis ("..."). Stereotypes are discussed in Chapter 6. To better organize long lists of attributes and operations, you can also prefix each group with a descriptive category by using stereotypes, as shown in Figure 4-7.
