 Use cases are discussed in Chapter 16; collaborations are discussed in Chapter 27. You'll also use realization to specify the relationship between a use case and the collaboration that realizes that use case, as Figure 10-10 shows. In this circumstance, you'll almost always use the canonical form of realization. Figure 10-10 Realization of a Use Case  Note When a class or a component realizes an interface, it means that clients can rely on the class or component to faithfully carry out the behavior specified by the interface. That means the class or component implements all the operations of the interface, responds to all its signals, and in all ways follows the protocol established by the interface for clients who use those operations or send those signals.
