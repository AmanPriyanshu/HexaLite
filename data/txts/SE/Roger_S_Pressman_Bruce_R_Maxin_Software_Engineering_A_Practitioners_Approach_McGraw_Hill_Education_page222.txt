 MODELING    
 
Class-responsibility-collaborator (CRC) modeling
 
 [Wir90] provides a simple means 
for identifying and organizing the classes that are relevant to system or product 

requirements. Ambler [Amb95] describes   
CRC modeling  
 in the following way: 
 
A CRC model is really a collection of standard index cards that represent classes. The cards are divided into three sections. Along the top of the card you write the 
name of the class. In the body of the card you list the class responsibilities on the left 
and the collaborators on the right.  
  
In reality, the CRC model may make use of actual or virtual index cards. The 
intent is to develop an organized representation of classes.  Responsibilities 
 are 
the attributes and operations that are relevant for the class. Stated simply, a 

responsibility is “anything the class knows or does” [Amb95].  Collaborators 
 are 
those classes that are required to provide a class with the information needed to 
complete a responsibility. In general, a  
collaboration 
 implies either a request for 
information or a request for some action.  
 
 
   
A simple CRC index card for the  FloorPlan 
 class is illustrated in  
Figure 10.3 . The list of responsibilities shown on the CRC card is preliminary and subject to 
additions or modiﬁ cation. The classes  
Wall
 
 and  
Camera 
 are noted next to the 
responsibility that will require their collaboration.    
Classes. 
  Basic guidelines for identifying classes and objects were pre-
sented earlier in this chapter. The taxonomy of class types presented in 

Section 10.1 can be extended by considering the following categories:  
 
 
 •   
Entity classes 
 
, 
 also called  model 
 or  business 
 classes, are extracted 
 directly from the statement of the problem (e.g.,  FloorPlan 
 and  Sensor 
).

  uote:  “One purpose of 
CRC cards is to 
fail early, to fail 

often, and to fail 
inexpensively. It 

is a lot cheaper to 
tear up a bunch of 
cards than it would 
be to reorganize 
a large amount of 
source code.”  C. Horstmann
