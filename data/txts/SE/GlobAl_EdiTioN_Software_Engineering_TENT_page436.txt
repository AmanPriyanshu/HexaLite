Chapter 18 introduces the related topic of service-oriented architectures, 
which link the notions of distribution and reuse. Services are reusable 

software components whose functionality can be accessed over the 

Internet. I discuss two widely-used approaches to service development 

namely SOAP-based and RESTful services. I explain what is involved in 

creating services (service engineering) and composing services to create 

new software systems.
The focus of Chapters 19Å’21 is systems engineering. In Chapter 19, 
I introduce the topic and explain why it is important that software 

engineers should understand systems engineering. I discuss the sys
-
tems engineering life cycle and the importance of procurement in that 

life-cycle.Chapter 20 covers systems of systems (SoS). The large systems that we 
will build in the 21st century will not be developed from scratch but will be created by integrating existing complex systems. I explain why an 

understanding of complexity is important in SoS development and dis
-
cuss architectural patterns for complex systems of systems.
Most software systems are not apps or business systems but are embed
-ded real-time systems. Chapter 21 covers this important topic. I introduce 

the idea of a real-time embedded system and describe architectural pat
-
terns that are used in embedded systems design. I then explain the pro
-
cess of timing analysis and conclude the chapter with a discussion of 

real-time operating systems.
