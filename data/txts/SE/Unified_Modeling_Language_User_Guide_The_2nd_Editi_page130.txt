As Figure 10-7 shows, composition is really just a special kind of association and is specified by adorning a plain association with a filled diamond at the whole end. Figure 10-7 Composition  Note Alternately, you can show composition by nesting the symbols of the parts within the symbol of the composite. This form is most useful when you want to emphasize the relationships among the parts that apply only in the context of the whole.  Attributes are discussed in Chapters 4 and 9. Association Classes   In an association between two classes, the association itself might have properties. For example, in an employer/employee relationship between a Company and a Person, there is a Job that represents the properties of that relationship that apply to exactly one pairing of the Person and Company. It wouldn't be appropriate to model this situation with a Company to Job association together with a Job to Person association. That wouldn't tie a specific instance of the Job to the specific pairing of Company and Person. In the UML, you'd model this as an association class, which is a modeling element that has both association and class properties. An association class can be seen as an association that also has class properties, or as a class that also has association properties. You render an association class as a class symbol attached by a dashed line to an association as in Figure 10-8. Figure 10-8 Association Classes
