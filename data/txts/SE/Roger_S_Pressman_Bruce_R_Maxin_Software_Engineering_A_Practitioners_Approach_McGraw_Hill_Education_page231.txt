ROBLEMS AND POINTS TO PONDER  
 
 
 
10.1.  You have been asked to build one of the following systems: 
  
 
 
 a.  
A network-based course registration system for your university. 
   
 
 b.  
A Web-based order-processing system for a computer store. 
   
 
 c.  
A simple invoicing system for a small business.    
 
 d.  
An Internet-based cookbook that is built into an electric range or microwave.   
    Select the system that is of interest to you and develop a processing narrative. Then use the grammatical parsing technique to identify candidate objects and classes.    
 
 
 
10.2.  Develop a set of operations that are used within the classes identiﬁ
 ed in Problem 10.1. 
   
 
10.3.  Develop a class model for the PHTRS system present in Problem 9.5.    
 
10.4.  Write a template-based use case for the  
SafeHome 
 home management system 
 described informally in the sidebar following Section 10.4.    
 
10.5.  Develop a complete set of CRC model index cards on the product or system you chose as part of Problem 10.1.    
 
10.6.  Conduct a review of the CRC index cards with your colleagues. How many additional classes, responsibilities, and collaborators were added as a consequence of the review?    
 
10.7.  What is an analysis package and how might it be used?

 READINGS AND INFORMATION
 SOURCES  
 
General class-based concepts are discussed by Weisfeld ( 
The Object-Oriented Thought Process
 
, 4th ed., Addison-Wesley, 2013). Class-based modeling methods are discussed in 
books by Bennet and Farmer (Object-Oriented Systems Analysis and Design Using UML, 
McGraw-Hill, 2010), Ashraﬁ  and Ashraﬁ
  ( 
Object-Oriented Systems Analysis and Design, 
 Prentice Hall, 2008), Booch ( Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications, 
 3rd 
ed., Addison-Wesley, 2007), George and his colleagues ( 
Object-Oriented Systems Analysis and Design 
, 2nd ed., Prentice Hall, 2006), O’Docherty ( Object-Oriented Analysis and  Design, 
 Wiley, 2005), Satzinger et al. ( 
Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with the Uniﬁ ed Pro-
cess, 
 Course Technology, 2004), Stumpf and Teague ( 
Object-Oriented Systems Analysis and  Design with UML, 
 Prentice Hall, 2004).   
 
UML modeling techniques that can be applied for both analysis and design are discussed by Dennis and his colleagues ( Systems Analysis and Design with UML Version 2.0,
 
 Wiley, 
ed., 2012), Ramnath and Dathan ( 
Object-Oriented Analysis and Design, 
 Springer, 2011), 
 Bennett and Farmer ( 
Object-Oriented Systems Analysis and Design Using UML, 
 McGraw-Hill, 
ed., 2010). Larman ( 
Applying UML and Patterns: An Introduction to Object-Oriented 
Analysis and Design and Iterative Development, 
 Dohrling Kindersley, 2008), Rosenberg and 
Stephens ( Use Case Driven Object Modeling with UML Theory and Practice, 
 Apress, 2007), 
and Arlow and Neustadt ( UML 2 and the Uniﬁ ed Process,
 
 2nd ed.,  
Addison-Wesley, 2005) all 
address the deﬁ nition of analysis classes within the context of UML. 
  
 
A wide variety of information sources on class-based methods for requirements model-ing are available on the Internet. An up-to-date list of World Wide Web references that are
