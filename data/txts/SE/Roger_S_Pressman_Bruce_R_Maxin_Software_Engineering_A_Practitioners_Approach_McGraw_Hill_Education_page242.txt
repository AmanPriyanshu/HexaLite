MODELING 
 
 
 
 
Participants.   This section of the patterns description “itemizes the classes/ob-jects that are included in the requirements pattern” [Kon02] and describes the 
responsibilities of each class/object ( Figure 11.3 ). An abbreviated list follows: 
 
 
 
•   
PassiveSensor abstract: 
 Deﬁ nes an interface for passive sensors. 
  
 
 
•   
PassiveBooleanSensor: 
 Deﬁ nes passive Boolean sensors. 
  
 
 
•   
PassiveIntegerSensor: 
 Deﬁ nes passive integer sensors. 
  
 
 
•   
PassiveRealSensor: 
 Deﬁ nes passive real sensors. 
  
 
 
•   
ActiveSensor abstract: 
 Deﬁ nes an interface for active sensors. 
  
 
 
•   
ActiveBooleanSensor: 
 Deﬁ nes active Boolean sensors. 
  
 
 
•   
ActiveIntegerSensor: 
 Deﬁ nes active integer sensors. 
  
 
 
•   
ActiveRealSensor: 
 Deﬁ nes active real sensors. 
  
 
 
•   
Actuator abstract: 
 Deﬁ nes an interface for actuators. 
  
 
 
•   
BooleanActuator: 
 Deﬁ nes Boolean actuators. 
  
 
 
•   
IntegerActuator: 
 Deﬁ nes integer actuators. 
  
 
 
•   
RealActuator: 
 Deﬁ nes real actuators. 
  
 
 
•   
ComputingComponent: 
 The central part of the controller; it gets the 
data from the sensors and computes the required response for the 

actuators. 
  
 
 
•   
ActiveComplexSensor: 
 Complex active sensors have the basic function-ality of the abstract  ActiveSensor 
 class, but additional, more elaborate, methods and attributes need to be speciﬁ ed. 
  
 
 
•   
PassiveComplexSensor: 
 Complex passive sensors have the basic function-ality of the abstract  PassiveSensor 
 class, but additional, more elaborate, methods and attributes need to be speciﬁ ed. 
  
 
 
•   
ComplexActuator: 
 Complex actuators also have the base functionality of the abstract  Actuator 
 class, but additional, more elaborate methods and attributes need to be speciﬁ ed. 
 
 
  
 
 
Collaborations.   This section describes how objects and classes interact with one another and how each carries out its responsibilities.  
 
 
•  When the  ComputingComponent 
 needs to update the value of a  PassiveSensor 
, it queries the sensors, requesting the value by sending the appropriate message.   
 
 
•   
ActiveSensors 
 are not queried. They initiate the transmission of sensor values to the computing unit, using the appropriate method to set the 
value in the  ComputingComponent . They send a life tick at least once during a speciﬁ ed time frame in order to update their timestamps with 
the system clock’s time.
