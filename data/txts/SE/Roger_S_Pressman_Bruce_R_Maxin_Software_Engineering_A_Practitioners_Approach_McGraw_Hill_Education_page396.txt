MODELING 
Architectural patterns deﬁ ne the overall structure of the WebApp, indicate 
the relationships among different components or increments, and deﬁ ne the 
rules for specifying relationships among the elements (pages, packages, com-
ponents, subsystems) of the architecture. Design patterns address a speciﬁ c ele-
ment of the WebApp design such as an aggregation of components to solve some 

design problem, relationships among elements on a page, or the mechanisms for 
effecting component-to-component communication. Component patterns relate 
to small-scale elements of a WebApp. Examples include individual interaction 

elements (e.g., radio buttons, textbooks), navigation items (e.g., how might you 
format links?) or functional elements (e.g., speciﬁ c algorithms). 
 
 
 
  
 
Hypermedia Design Patterns 
Repositories  There are a number of useful hypermedia pat-
terns catalogs and repositories on the Internet. Hundreds of 

design patterns are represented in these representative sites:

PATTERNS
 FOR MOBILE APPS  
 
By their nature, mobile applications are all about the interface. In many cases, mobile UI patterns [Mob12] are represented as a collection of “best of breed” 
screen images for apps in a variety of different categories. Typical examples 

might include:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Check-in screens. 
 How do I check in from a speciﬁ
 c location, make a 
comment, and share comments with friends and followers on a social 
network?    
 
 
 
 
 
Maps. 
 How do I display a map within the context of an app that ad-
dresses some other subject? For example, review a restaurant and repre-
sent its location within a city. 
   
 
 
 
 
 
Popovers. 
 How do I represent a message or information (from the app or 
another user) that arises in real time or as the consequence of a user action?
