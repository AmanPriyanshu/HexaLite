PART
 
 In this part of  Software Engineering: A Practitioner’s Ap-
proach,
 
 we consider a number of advanced topics that will 
extend your understanding of software engineering. The fol-lowing questions are addressed in the chapters that follow:  
 
 
•  What is software process improvement and how can it be used to improve the state of software engineering practice?   
 
 
•  What emerging trends can be expected to have a signiﬁ -cant inﬂ uence on software engineering practice in the next 
decade?   
 
 
•  What is the road ahead for software engineers?    
 
Once these questions are answered, you’ll understand topics that may have a profound impact on software engineering in 
the years to come.  ADVANCED
