Integration follows the pattern illustrated in  Figure 22.6 . Components are combined to form clusters 1, 2, and 3. Each of the clusters is tested using a driver 
(shown as a dashed block). Components in clusters 1 and 2 are subordinate to M a . Drivers D1 and D2 are removed and the clusters are interfaced directly to M a . Similarly, driver D3 for cluster 3 is removed prior to integration with module Mb. 

Both M a 
 and M b 
 will ultimately be integrated with component M c 
, and so forth.  As integration moves upward, the need for separate test drivers lessens. In fact, if the top two levels of program structure are integrated top down, the num-
ber of drivers can be reduced substantially and integration of clusters is greatly 
simpliﬁ ed. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Regression Testing.   
Each time a new module is added as part of integration testing, the software changes. New data ﬂ ow paths are established, new I/O 
may occur, and new control logic is invoked. Side effects associated with these 

changes may cause problems with functions that previously worked ﬂ awlessly. In 
the context of an integration test strategy,  
regression testing
 
 is the reexecution 
of some subset of tests that have already been conducted to ensure that changes 
have not propagated unintended side effects. Regression testing helps to ensure 
that changes (due to testing or for other reasons) do not introduce unintended 
behavior or additional errors.  Regression testing may be conducted manually, by reexecuting a subset of all 
test cases or using automated capture/playback tools.  Capture/playback tools
 
 enable the software engineer to capture test cases and results for subsequent    Regression testing is 
an important strategy 

for reducing “side ef-
fects.” Run regression 
tests every time a 

major change is made 
to the software (includ-
ing the integration of 
new components).    Bottom-up integration 

eliminates the need for 
complex stubs. McMaD2D3D1MbCluster 1Cluster 3Cluster 2 FIGURE 22.6
