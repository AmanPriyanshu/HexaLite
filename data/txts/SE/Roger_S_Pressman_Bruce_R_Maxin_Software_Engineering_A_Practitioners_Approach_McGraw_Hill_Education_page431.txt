CHAPTER 18  
MOBILEAPP DESIGN 401 
Early user interface prototypes for MobileApps can be created on paper, using 
sketches or a combination of index cards and/or post-it notes to emulate import-
ant interaction mechanisms. The key is to allow all interaction mechanisms to 
be assessed, all usage contexts to be examined, and all user interaction mech-
anisms to be speciﬁ ed. In addition, the use of interaction widgets and overall 
screen placement and location can also be emulated. These early rough paper 
prototypes can assist in uncovering errors, inconsistencies, and omissions before 
targeted mobile devices come into play. Later prototypes may then be created to 

run on targeted mobile devices once the layout and placement issues have been 
resolved.   
MobileApp Design Mistakes  
 
Joh Koester [Koe12] posts several examples of MobileApp design practices that should 
  
 
 
•   
Kitchen Sink 
. Avoid adding too many features to 
the app and too many widgets on the screen. Simple 
is understandable. Simple is marketable.   
 
 
•   
Inconsistency 
. To avoid this, set standards for page 
navigation, menu use, buttons, tabs, and other user-

interface elements. Stick to a uniform look and feel. 
  
 
 
•   
Overdesigning. 
 Be ruthless when designing a MobileApp. Remove unnecessary elements and 

wasteful graphics. Do not be tempted to add 
elements just because you think you should.   
 
 
•   
Lack of Speed 
. Users do not care about device constraints—they want to view things quickly. Preload 

what you can. Eliminate what is not needed.   
 
 
•   
Verbiage
 
. Unnecessarily long, wordy menus and screen displays are indications of a MobileApp that 
has not been tested with users and developers who 
have not spent enough time understanding the user’s 

task.   
 
 
•   
Nonstandard Interaction. 
 One reason for targeting a platform is to take advantage of the user’s 

experience with the ways things are done on that 
platform. Where standards exist use them. This needs 

to be balanced with the need to have an application 
appear and behave the same way on multiple 
devices when possible.   
 
 
•   
Help-and-FAQ-itis.
 
 Adding online help is not the way to repair a poorly designed user interface. 

Make sure you have tested your app with your 
targeted users and repaired the identiﬁ ed defects.

MOBILEAPP DESIGN—BEST PRACTICES  
 
There are several guidelines for developing MobileApps  16 
 
 and for developing 
apps for speciﬁ c platforms like Apple’s iOS 
 17 
 
 or Google’s Android.

 Schumacher 
[Sch09] has collected many best practice ideas and has posted several specially 
adapted to the design of a mobile application as Web pages.
