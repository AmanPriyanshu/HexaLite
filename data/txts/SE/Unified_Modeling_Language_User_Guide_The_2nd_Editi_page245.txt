the vocabulary of the system you are modeling. Typically, you capitalize the first letter of every word in a state name, as in Idle or ShuttingDown.  As Figure 21-2 shows, you represent a state as a rectangle with rounded corners. Figure 21-2 States  Initial and Final States   As the figure shows, there are two special states that may be defined for an object's state machine. First, there's the initial state, which indicates the default starting place for the state machine or substate. An initial state is represented as a filled black circle. Second, there's the final state, which indicates that the execution of the state machine or the enclosing state has been completed. A final state is represented as a filled black circle surrounded by an unfilled circle. Note Initial and final states are really pseudostates. Neither may have the usual parts of a normal state, except for a name. A transition from an initial state to a final state may have the full complement of features, including a guard condition and action (but not a trigger event).  Transitions A transition is a relationship between two states indicating that an object in the first state will perform certain actions and enter the second state when a specified event occurs and specified conditions are satisfied. On such a change of state, the transition is said to fire. Until the transition fires, the object is said to be in the source state; after it fires, it is said to be in the target state. For example, a Heater might transition from the Idle to the Activating state when an event such as tooCold (with the parameter desiredTemp) occurs. A transition has five parts. Events are discussed in Chapter 20. 1. Source state  The state affected by the transition; if an object is in the source state, an outgoing transition may fire when the object receives the trigger event of the transition and if the guard condition, if any, is satisfied
