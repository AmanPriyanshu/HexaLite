pool. It is shown graphically by enclosing the workflow for each participant in the 
process in a rectangle, with the name written vertically on the left edge. The work
-
flows in each pool are coordinated by exchanging messages. In situations where 

different parts of an organization are involved in a workflow, pools are divided into 

named ﬁlanes.ﬂ Each lane shows the activities in that part of the organization.
Once a business process model has been designed, it has to be refined depending 
on the services that have been discovered. As I suggested in the discussion of Figure 

18.14, the model may go through a number of iterations until a design that allows the 

maximum possible reuse of available services has been created.
Once the final design is available, you can then develop the final service-oriented 
system. This involves implementing services that are not available for reuse and con
-
verting the workflow model into an executable program. As services are implementa
-
tion-language independent, new services can be written in any language. The workflow 

model may be automatically processed to create an executable WS-BPEL model if 

SOAP-based services are used. Alternatively, if RESTful services are used, the work
-
flow may be manually programmed, with the model acting as a program specification.

Testing is important in all system development processes as it demonstrates that a 

system meets its functional and non-functional requirements and detects defects that RequestprocessorSet up jobparametersDownloaddataStart
