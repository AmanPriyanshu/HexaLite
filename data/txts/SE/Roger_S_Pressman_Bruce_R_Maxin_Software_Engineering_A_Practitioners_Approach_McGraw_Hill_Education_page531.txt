 The ﬂ
 ow graph depicts logical control ﬂ
 ow using the notation illus-
trated in  Figure 23.1 . Each structured construct (Chapter 14) has a corresponding ﬂ ow graph symbol. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
To illustrate the use of a ﬂ
 ow graph, consider the procedural design repre-
sentation in  Figure 23.2a . Here, a ﬂ owchart is used to depict program control 
structure.  Figure 23.2b  maps the ﬂ
 owchart into a corresponding ﬂ
 ow graph (as-
suming that no compound conditions are contained in the decision diamonds of 
the ﬂ owchart). Referring to  
Figure 23.2b , each circle, called a  ﬂ ow graph node,
 
 represents one or more procedural statements. A sequence of process boxes and 
a decision diamond can map into a single node. The arrows on the ﬂ ow graph, 
called  edges 
 or  
links, 
 represent ﬂ
 ow of control and are analogous to ﬂ
 owchart 
arrows. An edge must terminate at a node, even if the node does not represent    A ﬂ ow graph should be 
drawn only when the 
logical structure of a 

component is complex. 
The ﬂ ow graph allows 

you to trace program 
paths more readily. 
  
3  In actuality, the basis path method can be conducted without the use of ﬂ
 ow graphs. However, 
they serve as a useful notation for understanding control ﬂ ow and illustrating the approach.
