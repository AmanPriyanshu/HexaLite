THE SOFTWARE PROCESS
 
 
 
 
5.5.1 Scrum  
 
 
 
Scrum 
 (the name is derived from an activity that occurs during a rugby match) 
 9 
 
 is an agile software development method that was conceived by Jeff Sutherland 

and his development team in the early 1990s. In recent years, further devel-
opment on the Scrum methods has been performed by Schwaber and Beedle 

[Sch01b]. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Scrum principles are consistent with the agile manifesto and are used to guide development activities within a process that incorporates the following frame-
work activities: requirements, analysis, design, evolution, and delivery. Within 

each framework activity, work tasks occur within a process pattern (discussed in 

the following paragraph) called a  sprint.  
The work conducted within a sprint (the number of sprints required for each framework activity will vary depending on 
product complexity and size) is adapted to the problem at hand and is deﬁ ned 
and often modiﬁ ed in real time by the Scrum team. The overall ﬂ
 ow of the Scrum 
process is illustrated in  Figure 5.3 .
