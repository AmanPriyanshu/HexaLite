For example,  project planning 
 is one of eight process areas deﬁ
 ned by the 
CMMI for “project management” category.

 The speciﬁ c goals (SG) and the asso-
ciated speciﬁ c practices (SP) deﬁ
 ned for  
project planning 
 are [CMM07]: 
 
 
 
SG 1 Establish Estimates   SP 1.1-1 Estimate the Scope of the Project  SP 1.2-1 Establish Estimates of Work Product and Task Attributes 
 SP 1.3-1 Deﬁ ne Project Life Cycle 
 SP 1.4-1 Determine Estimates of Effort and Cost   
SG 2 Develop a Project Plan   SP 2.1-1 Establish the Budget and Schedule  SP 2.2-1 Identify Project Risks  SP 2.3-1 Plan for Data Management  SP 2.4-1 Plan for Project Resources  SP 2.5-1 Plan for Needed Knowledge and Skills  SP 2.6-1 Plan Stakeholder Involvement  SP 2.7-1 Establish the Project Plan   
SG 3 Obtain Commitment to the Plan 
  SP 3.1-1 Review Plans That Affect the Project  SP 3.2-1 Reconcile Work and Resource Levels 
 SP 3.3-1 Obtain Plan Commitment    
 
 
 
 
 
In addition to speciﬁ c goals and practices, the CMMI also deﬁ
 nes a set of 
ﬁ ve generic goals and related practices for each process area. Each of the ﬁ
 ve 
generic goals corresponds to one of the ﬁ ve capability levels. Hence, to achieve 
a particular capability level, the generic goal for that level and the generic prac-
tices that correspond to that goal must be achieved.  
 
  The staged CMMI model deﬁ nes the same process areas, goals, and practices 
as the continuous model. The primary difference is that the staged model deﬁ nes 
ﬁ ve maturity levels, rather than ﬁ
 ve capability levels. To achieve a maturity level, 
the speciﬁ c goals and practices associated with a set of process areas must be 
achieved. The relationship between maturity levels and process areas is shown 
in

7  Other process areas deﬁ
 ned for “project management” include: project monitoring and con-
trol, supplier agreement management, integrated project management for IPPD, risk man-
agement, integrated teaming, integrated supplier management, and quantitative project 
management. pre22126_ch37_817-838.indd   830pre22126_ch37_817-838.indd   83013/12/13   6:17 PM13/12/13   6:17 PM
