12.4.5 Deployment-Level Design Elements 
 
Deployment-level design elements indicate how software functionality and sub-systems will be allocated within the physical computing environment that will 
support the software. For example, the elements of the  SafeHome 
 product are 
conﬁ gured to operate within three primary computing environments—a home-
based PC, the  SafeHome 
 control panel, and a server housed at CPI Corp. (provid-
ing Internet-based access to the system). In addition, limited functionality may 
be provided with mobile platforms.    
During design, a UML deployment diagram is developed and then reﬁ ned as 
shown in  Figure 12.7 . In the ﬁ gure, three computing environments are shown (in 
actuality, there would be more including sensors, cameras, and functionality de-

livered by mobile platforms). The subsystems (functionality) housed within each 
computing element are indicated. For example, the personal computer houses 
subsystems that implement security, surveillance, home management, and com-

munications features. In addition, an external access subsystem has been de-
signed to manage all attempts to access the  SafeHome 
 system from an external 
source. Each subsystem would be elaborated to indicate the components that it 
implements.  The diagram shown in  Figure 12.7  is in  
descriptor form. 
 This means that the de-
ployment diagram shows the computing environment but does not explicitly in-
dicate conﬁ guration details. For example, the “personal computer” is not further 
   Deployment diagrams 
begin in descriptor 
form, where the de-

ployment environment 
is described in general 
terms. Later, instance 

form is used and 

elements of the con-
ﬁ guration are explicitly 

described. CPI server
