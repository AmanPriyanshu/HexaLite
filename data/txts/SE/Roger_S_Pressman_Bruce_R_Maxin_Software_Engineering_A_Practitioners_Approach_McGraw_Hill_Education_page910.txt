  COMMUNICATION
 DIAGRAMS   
The UML  communication diagram  (known as a “collaboration diagram” in UML 1.X) provides another indication of the temporal order of the communications 
but emphasizes the relationships among the objects and classes instead of the 
temporal order. A communication diagram is illustrated in   Figure A1.10, which displays the same actions shown in the sequence diagram in   Figure A1.7. 
  
In a communication diagram the interacting objects are represented by rect-angles. Associations between objects are represented by lines connecting the 
rectangles. There is typically an incoming arrow to one object in the diagram 
that starts the sequence of message passing. That arrow is labeled with a number 
and a message name. If the incoming message is labeled with the number 1 and 
if it causes the receiving object to invoke other messages on other objects, then  F
