˚˛˝˙ˆˇ˘˜˜˜˜˜˜˜an interaction with the system. Each possible interaction is named in an ellipse, and the external entity involved in the interaction is represented by a stick figure.The use case model for the weather station is shown in Figure 
7.2. This shows 
that the weather station interacts with the weather information system to report 

weather data and the status of the weather station hardware. Other interactions are 
with a control system that can issue specific weather station control commands. The 
stick figure is used in the UML to represent other systems as well as human users.Each of these use cases should be described in structured natural language. This helps designers identify objects in the system and gives them an understanding of 

what the system is intended to do. I use a standard format for this description that 
clearly identifies what information is exchanged, how the interaction is initiated, and 
so on. As I explain in Chapter 21, embedded systems are often modeled by 
 describing
