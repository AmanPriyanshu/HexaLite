574 PART THREE  
QUALITY MANAGEMENT 
Cloud-based testing is not without potential problems: lack of standards, po-tential security issues, data location and integrity issues, incomplete infrastruc-
ture support, improper usages of services, and performance issues are only 
some of the common challenges that face development teams that use the cloud 
approach.

MobileApp Testing in the Production Environment 
  
 
The scene:  Doug Miller’s ofﬁ
 ce. 
  
The players:  Doug Miller (manager of the  
SafeHome 
 software engineering group) and Vinod Raman (a mem-
ber of the product software engineering team).   
The conversation:    
Doug:  What do you think of the e-commerce portion 
of our   
SafeHomeAssured  
 MobileApp V0.0?   
Vinod:  The outsourcing vendor has done a good job 
of adapting the WebApp  
 
SafeHomeAssured.com  
 to the mobile environment. Sharon [development manager 
for the vendor] tells me they’re testing the prototype as 
we speak.   
Doug:  I heard they were doing testing for the 
e-commerce site using device emulators. I think we 
should do a little testing on actual devices.   
Vinod (grimacing):  I thought we were going to hire 
a third-party testing company to validate the Mobile-

App. We’re still killing ourselves trying to get the prod-

uct software out the door. 
  
Doug:  We’re going to hire a testing vendor for perfor-
mance, security testing, and conﬁ guration testing. Our 
outsourcing vendor is already doing some testing. I just thought another point of view would be helpful, and   
Vinod (sighs):  What are you looking for? 
  
Doug:  I want to be sure that the user experience is 
solid.   
Vinod:  I suppose we can start with the use cases for 
each of the major interface functions. 
  
Doug:  Good. But follow the logic paths from their be-
ginning to their conclusion. Take a look at the weighted 

device platform matrix. I’d like you to check its perfor-

mance on the top six most important devices, and while 

you’re there, check out the content that appears at each 
navigation node. Make sure it takes the device charac-
teristics into account as each screen display is rendered.   
Vinod:  
well. Who’s testing usability? 
  
Doug:  
ability testing. We’ve hired a market research ﬁ
 rm to 
line up 20 typical users for the usability study, but if you 

  
Vinod:  I know, pass them along. 
  
Doug (smiling):  Thanks, Vinod.

CONSIDERING THE SPECTRUM OF USER INTERACTION  
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a crowded marketplace in which products provide the same functionality, 
users will choose the MobileApp that is easiest to use. The user interface and its 
interaction mechanisms are visible to the MobileApp users. It is important to test 
the quality of the user experience provided by the MobileApp to ensure that it 
meets the expectations of its users.  Many of the procedures for assessing the usability of software user interfaces discussed in Chapter 15 can be used to assess MobileApps. Similarly many of the 
strategies used to assess the quality of WebApps (Chapter 25) may be used to test 
 What 
characteristics 
of MobileApp 

usability become 

the focus of testing 

and what speciﬁ c 
objectives are 

addressed?
