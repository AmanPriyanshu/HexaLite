COMPONENT-LEVEL DESIGN PATTERNS
  
 
Component-level design patterns provide you with proven solutions that address one or more subproblems extracted from the requirements model. In many 
cases, design patterns of this type focus on some functional element of a system. 
For example, the  SafeHomeAssured.com  application must address the following design subproblem:  How do I get product speciﬁ
 cations and related information 
for any SafeHome device? 
  Having enunciated the subproblem that must be solved, you should now con-sider context and the system of forces that affect the solution. Examining the 
appropriate requirements model use case, you learn that the consumer uses the 
speciﬁ cation for a  
SafeHome 
 device (e.g., a security sensor or camera) for infor-
mational purposes. However, other information that is related to the speciﬁ
 ca-
tion (e.g., pricing) may be used when e-commerce functionality is selected.  The solution to the subproblem involves a search. Since searching is a very com-mon problem, it should come as no surprise that there are many search-related   
Design Pattern Repositories 
 
There are many sources for design patterns 
available on the Web. Some patterns can be 
obtained from individually published pattern languages, 

while others are available as part of a patterns portal 

or patterns repository. The following Web sources are 

worth a look:
