Figure 2-10 Packages  Packages are the basic grouping things with which you may organize a UML model. There are also variations, such as frameworks, models, and subsystems (kinds of packages). Notes are discussed in Chapter 6. Annotational Things   Annotational thingsare the explanatory parts of UML models. These are the comments you may apply to describe, illuminate, and remark about any element in a model. There is one primary kind of annotational thing, called a note. A note is simply a symbol for rendering constraints and comments attached to an element or a collection of elements. Graphically, a note is rendered as a rectangle with a dog-eared corner, together with a textual or graphical comment, as in Figure 2-11. Figure 2-11 Notes  This element is the one basic annotational thing you may include in a UML model. You'll typically use notes to adorn your diagrams with constraints or comments that are best expressed in informal or formal text. There are also variations on this element, such as requirements (which specify some desired behavior from the perspective of outside the model). Relationships in the UML    There are four kinds of relationships in the UML: 1. Dependency 2. Association 3. Generalization 4. Realization These relationships are the basic relational building blocks of the UML. You use them to write well-formed models.
