QUALITY MANAGEMENT 
Many of the concepts introduced for object-oriented systems are also applica-ble for the black box. Data abstractions and the operations that manipulate those 
abstractions are encapsulated by the black box. Like a class hierarchy, the black-

box speciﬁ cation can exhibit usage hierarchies in which low-level boxes inherit 
the properties of those boxes higher in the tree structure.

State-Box Speciﬁ cation 
 
The  state box 
 is “a simple generalization of a state machine” [Mil88]. Recalling 
the discussion of behavioral modeling and state diagrams in Chapter 11, a state 
is some observable mode of system behavior. As processing occurs, a system re-

sponds to events (stimuli) by making a transition from the current state to some 
new state. As the transition is made, an action may occur. The state box uses a 

data abstraction to determine the transition to the next state and the action (re-
sponse) that will occur as a consequence of the transition.  Referring to  Figure 28.4 , the state box incorporates a black box  g. 
 The stimulus 
 S 
 that is input to the black box arrives from some external source and a set of 
internal system states  T. 
 Mills [Mil88] provides a mathematical description of the 
function  f 
 of the black box contained within the state box: g 
:  S* 
 3  T* 
   R 
 3  T 
  where  g 
 is a subfunction that is tied to a speciﬁ
 c state  
t 
. When considered collec-tively, the state-subfunction pairs ( 
t, g 
) deﬁ ne the black-box function  
f.
