proactive resistance where defenses are included in a system to trap problems and 
reactive resistance where actions are taken when a problem is discovered.3. Recovery If a failure occurs, the aim of the recovery activity is to ensure that critical system services are restored quickly so that system users are not seri-ously affected by the failure.4. Reinstatement In this final activity, all of the system services are restored, and 
normal system operation can continue.These activities lead to changes to the system state as shown in Figure 14.1, 
which shows the state changes in the system in the event of a cyberattack. In parallel 
with normal system operation, the system monitors network traffic for possible 

cyberattacks. In the event of a cyberattack, the system moves to a resistance state in 
which normal services may be restricted.If resistance successfully repels the attack, normal service is resumed. Otherwise, the 
system moves to a recovery state where only critical services are available. Repairs to the 

damage caused by the cyberattack are carried out. Finally, when repairs are complete, 

the system moves to a reinstatement state. In this state, the system™s services are incre-
mentally restored. Finally, when all restoration is complete, normal service is resumed.As the Apollo 13 example illustrates, resilience cannot be ﬁprogrammed inﬂ to a system. It is impossible to anticipate everything that might go wrong and every con-
text where problems might arise. The key to resilience, therefore, is flexibility and 
adaptability. As I discuss in Section 14.2, it should be possible for system operators 
and managers to take actions to protect and repair the system, even if these actions 
are abnormal or are normally disallowed.Increasing the resilience of a system of course has significant costs. Software 
may have to be purchased or modified, and additional investments made in hardware 

or cloud services to provide backup systems that can be used in the event of a system 
failure. The benefits from these costs are impossible to calculate because the losses 
from a failure or attack can only be calculated after the event.Companies may therefore be reluctant to invest in resilience if they have never 
suffered a serious attack or associated loss. However, the increasing number of
