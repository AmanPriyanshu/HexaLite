 On the other hand, a programmer responsible for implementing this scenario would have to build on this diagram, expanding certain messages and adding other players in this interaction, as in Figure 7-2. Figure 7-2 Interaction at a Low Level of Abstraction  Both of these diagrams work against the same model, but at different levels of detail. It's reasonable to have many diagrams such as these, especially if your tools make it easy to navigate from one diagram to another. Modeling Complex Views No matter how you break up your models, there are times when you'll find it necessary to create large and complex diagrams. For example, if you want to analyze the entire schema of a database encompassing 100 or more abstractions, it really is valuable to study a diagram showing all these classes and their associations. In so doing, you'll be able to see common
