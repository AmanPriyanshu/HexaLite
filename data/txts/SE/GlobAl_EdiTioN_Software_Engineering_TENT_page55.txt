There are three main activities in the requirements engineering process:1. Requirements elicitation and analysis 
This is the process of deriving the system 
requirements through observation of existing systems, discussions with poten-
tial users and procurers, task analysis, and so on. This may involve the develop-
ment of one or more system models and prototypes. These help you understand 

the system to be specified.2. Requirements specification Requirements specification is the activity of trans-
lating the information gathered during requirements analysis into a document 

that defines a set of requirements. Two types of requirements may be included 
in this document. User requirements are abstract statements of the system 

requirements for the customer and end-user of the system; system requirements 
are a more detailed description of the functionality to be provided.3. Requirements validation 
This activity checks the requirements for realism, 

consistency, and completeness. During this process, errors in the require-
ments document are inevitably discovered. It must then be modified to correct 

these problems.Requirements analysis continues during definition and specification, and new 
requirements come to light throughout the process. Therefore, the activities of analy-
sis, definition, and specification are interleaved.In agile methods, requirements specification is not a separate activity but is seen as part of system development. Requirements are informally specified for each 

increment of the system just before that increment is developed. Requirements are 
specified according to user priorities. The elicitation of requirements comes from 

users who are part of or work closely with the development team.Requirements
