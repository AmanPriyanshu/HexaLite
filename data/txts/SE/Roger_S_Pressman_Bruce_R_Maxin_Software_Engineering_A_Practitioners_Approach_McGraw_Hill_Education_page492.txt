QUALITY MANAGEMENTentire life cycle including planning, controlling, measuring, testing and reporting, 
and improving quality levels throughout the development and manufacturing pro-
cess. ISO 9000 describes quality assurance elements in generic terms that can be 

applied to any business regardless of the products or services offered. 
 To become registered to one of the quality assurance system models contained 
in ISO 9000, a company’s quality system and operations are scrutinized by third-

party auditors for compliance to the standard and for effective operation. Upon 
successful registration, a company is issued a certiﬁ cate from a registration body 
represented by the auditors. Semiannual surveillance audits ensure continued 
compliance to the standard.  
 
 
   
The requirements delineated by ISO 9001:2008 address topics such as manage-ment responsibility, quality system, contract review, design control, document and 

data control, product identiﬁ cation and traceability, process control, inspection 
and testing, corrective and preventive action, control of quality records, internal 

quality audits, training, servicing, and statistical techniques. In order for a software 

organization to become registered to ISO 9001:2008, it must establish policies and 

procedures to address each of the requirements just noted (and others) and then 

be able to demonstrate that these policies and procedures are being followed. If 

you desire further information on ISO 9001:2008, see [Coc11], [Hoy09], or [Cia09].
