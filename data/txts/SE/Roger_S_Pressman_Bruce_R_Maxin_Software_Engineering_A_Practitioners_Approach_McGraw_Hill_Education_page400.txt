Classic books by the architect Christopher Alexander ( Notes on the Synthesis of Form, 
 Harvard University Press, 1964, and  A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction,
 
 Oxford University Press, 1977) are worthwhile reading for a software designer who intends 
to fully understand design patterns.   
 
A wide variety of information sources on pattern-based design are available on the In-ternet. An up-to-date list of World Wide Web references that are relevant to pattern-based 

design can be found at the SEPA website:
