MODELINGDrawing on these diverse skills allows the creation of a model that can be assessed for quality and improved  before
 
 content and code are generated, tests are conducted, 
and end-users become involved in large numbers. If analysis is where  WebApp quality 
is established, 
 then design is where the  quality is truly embedded. 
  
 
 
The appropriate mix of design skills will vary depending upon the nature of the WebApp.  
Figure 17.2  depicts a design pyramid for WebApps. Each level of the 
pyramid represents a design action that is described in the sections that follow.

WEBAPP INTERFACE
 DESIGN  
 
When a user interacts with a computer-based system, a set of fundamental 
principles and overriding design guidelines apply. These have been discussed 

in Chapter 15.  3 
 
 Although WebApps present a few special user interface design 
challenges, the basic principles and guidelines are applicable.   One of the challenges of interface design for WebApps is the indeterminate 
nature of the user’s entry point. That is, the user may enter the WebApp at a 

“home” location (e.g., the home page) or may be linked into some lower level of 
the WebApp architecture. In some cases, the WebApp can be designed in a way 

that reroutes the user to a home location, but if this is undesirable, the WebApp 

design must provide interface navigation features that accompany all content 
objects and are available regardless of how the user enters the system.  The objectives of a WebApp interface are to: (1) establish a consistent window 
into the content and functionality provided by the interface, (2) guide the user 
through a series of interactions with the WebApp, and (3) organize the navigation 

options and content available to the user. To achieve a consistent interface, you 
  uote:  “If a site is 
perfectly usable 
but it lacks an 
elegant and 
appropriate design 
style, it will fail.”  Curt Cloninger
