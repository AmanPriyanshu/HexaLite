  Relationships Dependency A dependency is a semantic relationship between two things in which a change to one thing (the independent thing) may affect the semantics of the other thing (the dependent thing).   Association An association is a structural relationship that describes a set of links; a link is a connection among objects.   Generalization Generalization is a specialization/generalization relationship in which objects of the specialized element (the child) are substitutable for objects of the generalized element (the parent).
