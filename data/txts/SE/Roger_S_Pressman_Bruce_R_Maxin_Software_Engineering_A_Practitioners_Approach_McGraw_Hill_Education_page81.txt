 state.   Concurrent modeling is applicable to all types of software development and provides an accurate picture of the current state of a project. Rather than con-
ﬁ ning software engineering activities, actions, and tasks to a sequence of events, 
it deﬁ nes a process network. Each activity, action, or task on the network exists 
simultaneously with other activities, actions, or tasks. Events generated at one 
point in the process network trigger transitions among the states associated with 
each activity.

We have already noted that modern computer software is characterized by con-
tinual change, by very tight time lines, and by an emphatic need for  customer–user satisfaction. In many cases, time-to-market is the most important management Under reviewBaselinedUnderrevisionAwaiting
