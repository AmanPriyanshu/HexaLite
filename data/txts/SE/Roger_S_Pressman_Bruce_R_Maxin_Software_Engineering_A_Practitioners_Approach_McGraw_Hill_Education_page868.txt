Mutafelija and Stromberg ( Systematic Process Improvement Using ISO 9001:2000 and CMMI,
 
 Artech House Publishers, 2007) discuss both the ISO 9001:2000 and CMMI SPI frameworks 
and the “synergy” between them. Conradi and his colleagues ( Software Process Improve-

 Springer, 2006) presents the results of a series 
of case studies and experiments related to SPI.
