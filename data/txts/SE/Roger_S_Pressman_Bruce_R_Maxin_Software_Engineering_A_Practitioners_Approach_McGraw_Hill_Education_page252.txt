MODELINGwhole. To accomplish this, states are identiﬁ
 ed, the events that cause a class (or 
the system) to make a transition from one state to another are deﬁ ned, and the 
actions that occur as transition is accomplished are also identiﬁ ed. State dia-
grams and sequence diagrams are the notation used for behavioral modeling.  Analysis patterns enable a software engineer to use existing domain knowl-edge to facilitate the creation of a requirements model. An analysis pattern 
describes a speciﬁ c software feature or function that can be described by a co-
herent set of use cases. It speciﬁ es the intent of the pattern, the motivation for 
its use, constraints that limit its use, its applicability in various problem domains, 
the overall structure of the pattern, its behavior and collaborations, and other 
supplementary information.  Requirements modeling for mobile applications and WebApps can use most, 
if not all, of the modeling elements discussed in this book. However, these ele-

ments are applied within a set of specialized models that address content, in-
teraction, function, navigation, and the conﬁ guration in which the mobile app or 
WebApp resides.

ROBLEMS AND POINTS TO PONDER  
 
 
 
11.1.  There are two different types of “states” that behavioral models can represent. What are they?    
 
11.2.  How does a sequence diagram differ from a state diagram? How are they similar?    
 
11.3.  Suggest three requirements patterns for a modern mobile phone and write a brief description of each. Could these patterns be used for other devices? Provide an example.    
 
11.4.  Select one of the patterns you developed in Problem 11.3 and develop a reason-ably complete pattern description similar in content and style to the one presented in 
   
 
11.5.  How much analysis modeling do you think would be required for  www.safehomeassured

? Would each of the model types described in Section 11.5.3 be required? 
   
 
11.6.  What is the purpose of the interaction model for a WebApp? 
   
 
11.7.  It could be argued that a WebApp functional model should be delayed until design. 
Present pros and cons for this argument.    
 
11.8.  What is the purpose of a conﬁ guration model? 
   
 
11.9.  How does the navigation model differ from the interaction model?
