CHAPTER 19  
QUALITY CONCEPTS 429work products to determine their quality. Failure costs encompass the internal 
price of failure and the external effects that poor quality precipitates.  Software quality is achieved through the application of software engineering methods, solid management practices, and comprehensive quality control—all 
supported by a software quality assurance infrastructure. In the chapters that 
follow, quality control and assurance are discussed in some detail.

ROBLEMS AND POINTS TO PONDER  
 
 
 
19.1   Describe how you would assess the quality of a university before applying to it. What factors would be important? Which would be critical?    
 
19.2   Garvin [Gar84] describes ﬁ ve different views of quality. Provide an example of each 
using one or more well-known electronic products with which you are familiar. 
   
 
19.3   Using the deﬁ nition of software quality proposed in Section 19.2, do you think it’s pos-
sible to create a useful product that provides measurable value without using an effective 
process? Explain your answer. 
   
 
19.4   Add two additional questions to each of Garvin’s quality dimensions presented in Sec-
tion 19.2.1.    
 
19.5   McCall’s quality factors were developed during the 1970s. Almost every aspect of com-
puting has changed dramatically since the time that they were developed, and yet, McCall’s 

factors continue to apply to modern software. Can you draw any conclusions based on this 
fact?    
 
19.6   Using the subattributes noted for the ISO 9126 quality factor “maintainability” in Sec-tion 19.2.3, develop a set of questions that explore whether or not these attributes are pres-
ent. Follow the example shown in Section 19.2.4.    
 
19.7   Describe the software quality dilemma in your own words.    
 
19.8   What is “good enough” software? Name a speciﬁ c company and speciﬁ
 c products that 
you believe were developed using the good enough philosophy. 
   
 
19.9   Considering each of the four aspects of the cost of quality, which do you think is the 
most expensive and why?    
 
19.10   Do a Web search and ﬁ
 nd three other examples of “risks” to the public that can be 
directly traced to poor software quality. Consider beginning your search at

.    
 
19.11   Are  quality 
 and  
security 
 the same thing? Explain.    
 
19.12   Explain why it is that many of us continue to live by Meskimen’s law. What is it about 
the software business that causes this?
