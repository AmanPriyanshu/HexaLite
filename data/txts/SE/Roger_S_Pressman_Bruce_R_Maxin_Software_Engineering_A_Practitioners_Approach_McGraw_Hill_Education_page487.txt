21.6.1   
A Generic Example  
To illustrate the use of statistical methods for software engineering work, assume 
that a software engineering organization collects information on errors and de-
fects for a period of one year. Some of the errors are uncovered as software is 

being developed. Other defects are encountered after the software has been re-
leased to its end users. Although hundreds of different problems are uncovered, 
all can be tracked to one (or more) of the following causes:  
 
 
•  Incomplete or erroneous speciﬁ cations (IES). 
  
 
 
•  Misinterpretation of customer communication (MCC).   
 
 
•  Intentional deviation from speciﬁ cations (IDS). 
  
 
 
•  Violation of programming standards (VPS). 
  
 
 
•  Error in data representation (EDR).   
 
 
•  Inconsistent component interface (ICI).   
 
 
•  Error in design logic (EDL).   
 
 
•  Incomplete or erroneous testing (IET).   
 
 
•  Inaccurate or incomplete documentation (IID).   
 
 
•  Error in programming language translation of design (PLT). 
  
 
 
•  Ambiguous or inconsistent human/computer interface (HCI).   
 
 
•  Miscellaneous (MIS).  
 
  To apply statistical SQA, the table in  
Figure 21.2  is built. The table indicates 
that IES, MCC, and EDR are the vital few causes that account for 53 percent 
of all errors. It should be noted, however, that IES, EDR, PLT, and EDL would 

be selected as the vital few causes if only serious errors are considered. Once   uote:  “A statistical 
analysis, properly 
conducted, is a 
delicate dissection 
of uncertainties, 
a surgery of 

suppositions.”  M. J. Moroney
