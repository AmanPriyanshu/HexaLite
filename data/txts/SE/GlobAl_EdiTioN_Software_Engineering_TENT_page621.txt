These architectural patterns should be the starting point for an embedded systems design; however, they are not design templates. If you use them as such, you will probably end up with an inefficient process architecture. You have to optimize the 

process structure to ensure that you do not have too many processes. You also should 
ensure that there is a clear correspondence between the processes and the sensors 

and actuators in the system.Monitoring systems are an important class of embedded real-time systems. A moni-
toring system examines its environment through a set of sensors and usually displays 
the state of the environment in some way. This could be on a built-in screen, on 

special-purpose instrument displays, or on a remote display. If the system detects 

some exceptional event or sensor state, the monitoring system takes some action. 
NameObserve and ReactDescriptionThe input values of a set of sensors of the same types are 
collected and analyzed. These values are displayed in some 
way. If the sensor values indicate that some exceptional 
condition has arisen, then actions are initiated to draw the 
operator™s attention to that value and, if necessary, take actions 
in response to the exceptional value.StimuliValues from sensors attached to the system.ResponsesOutputs to display, alarm triggers, signals to reacting systems.ProcessesObserver, Analysis, Display, Alarm, Reactor.Used inMonitoring systems, alarm systems.Figure 21.6 The Observe and React
