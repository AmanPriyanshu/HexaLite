Figure 1.1 Frequently asked questions about software engineeringQuestionAnswerWhat is software?Computer programs and associated documentation. Software 
products may be developed for a particular customer or may be 
developed for a general market.What are the attributes of good 
software?Good software should deliver the required functionality and 
performance to the user and should be maintainable, dependable 
and usable.What is software engineering?Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned 
with all aspects of software production from initial conception to 
operation and maintenance.What are the fundamental 
software engineering activities?Software specification, software development, software validation 
and software evolution.What is the difference between 
software engineering and 
computer science?Computer science focuses on theory and fundamentals; software 
engineering is concerned with the practicalities of developing and 
delivering useful software.What is the difference between 
software engineering and system 
engineering?System engineering is concerned with all aspects of computer-
based systems development including hardware, software and 
process engineering. Software engineering is part of this more 
general process.What are the key challenges 
facing software engineering?Coping with increasing diversity, demands for reduced delivery 
times and developing trustworthy software.What are the costs of software 
engineering?Roughly 60% of software costs are development costs, 40% are 
testing costs. For custom software, evolution costs often exceed 
development costs.What are the best software 
engineering techniques and 
methods?While all software projects have to be professionally managed and 
developed, different techniques are appropriate for different types 
of system. For example, games should always be developed using 
a series of prototypes whereas safety critical control systems 
require a complete and analyzable specification to be developed. 
There are no methods and techniques that are good for everything.What differences has the Internet 
made to software engineering?Not only has the Internet led to the development of massive, highly 
distributed, service-based systems, it has also supported the 
creation of an ﬁappﬂ industry for mobile devices which has 
changed the economics of software.and you don™t have to worry about writing program guides, documenting the pro-
gram design, and so on. However, if you are writing software that other people will 

use and other engineers will change, then you usually have to provide additional 

information as well as the code of the program.Software engineers are concerned with developing software products, that is, 
software that can be sold to a customer. There are two kinds of software product:1. Generic products These are stand-alone systems that are produced by a 
development organization and sold on the open market to any customer who is 
able to buy them. Examples of this type of product include apps for mobile 

devices, software for PCs such as databases, word processors, drawing packages, 
and project management tools. This kind of software also includes ﬁverticalﬂ
