(4) a strategy for assisting a software organization in implementing those process characteristics that have been found to be weak or missing.  An SPI framework assesses the “maturity” of an organization’s software pro-
cess and provides a qualitative indication of a maturity level. In fact, the term 
“maturity model” (Section 37.1.2) is often applied. In essence, the SPI framework 
encompasses a maturity model that in turn incorporates a set of process quality 
indicators that provide an overall measure of the process quality that will lead 
to product quality. 
  
 
Figure 37.1  
 provides an overview of a typical SPI framework. The key elements 
of the framework and their relationship to one another are shown.  
 
 
 
   
You should note that there is no universal SPI framework. In fact, the SPI frame-
work that is chosen by an organization reﬂ ects the constituency that is championing 
the SPI effort. Conradi [Con96] deﬁ nes six different SPI support constituencies: 
  
Quality certifiers.   Process improvement efforts championed by this 
group focus on the following relationship:   
 
Quality 
( Process
 
)   Quality 
( Product
 
)  
  Their approach is to emphasize assessment methods and to examine a well-deﬁ ned set of characteristics that allows them to determine whether 
the process exhibits quality. They are most likely to adopt a process 

framework such as the CMMI, SPICE, TickIT, or Bootstrap.
