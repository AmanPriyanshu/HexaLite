Rational Unified Process    Characteristics of the Process    Phases and Iterations  Glossary    Glossary Preface The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a graphical language for visualizing, specifying, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of a software-intensive system. The UML gives you a standard way to write a system's blueprints, covering conceptual things, such as business processes and system functions, as well as concrete things, such as classes written in a specific programming language, database schemas, and reusable software components. This book teaches you how to use the UML effectively. Goals In this book, you will · Learn what the UML is, what it is not, and why the UML is relevant to the process of developing software-intensive systems · Master the vocabulary, rules, and idioms of the UML and, in general, learn how to "speak" the language effectively · Understand how to apply the UML to solve a number of common modeling problems The user guide provides a reference to the use of specific UML features. However, it is not intended to be a comprehensive reference manual for the UML; that is the focus of another book, The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manua l (Rumbaugh, Jacobson, Booch, Addison-Wesley, 1999). The user guide describes a development process for use with the UML. However, it is not intended to provide a complete reference to that process; that is the focus of yet another book, The Unified Software Development Process (Jacobson, Booch, Rumbaugh, Addison-Wesley, 1999). Finally, this book provides hints and tips for using the UML to solve a number of common modeling problems, but it does not teach you how to model. This is similar to a user guide for a programming language that teaches you how to use the language but does not teach you how to program. Audience
