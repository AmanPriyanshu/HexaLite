CHAPTER 15  
USER INTERFACE DESIGN
 333computer (while I’m at work or traveling), I can determine the status of the alarm sys-tem, arm or disarm the system, reconﬁ gure security zones, and view different rooms 
within the house via preinstalled video cameras.  To access  
SafeHome 
 from a remote location, I provide an identiﬁ
 er and a pass-
word. These deﬁ ne levels of access (e.g., all users may not be able to reconﬁ
 gure the 
system) and provide security. Once validated, I can check the status of the system and 

change the status by arming or disarming  SafeHome. 
 I can reconﬁ
 gure the system by 
displaying a ﬂ oor plan of the house, viewing each of the security sensors, displaying 
each currently conﬁ gured zone, and modifying zones as required. I can view the in-
terior of the house via strategically placed video cameras. I can pan and zoom each 
camera to provide different views of the interior. 
 
  
Based on this use case, the following homeowner tasks, objects, and data items are identiﬁ ed:
 
 
 
 
•   
Accesses 
 the  SafeHome 
 system   
 
 
•   
Enters 
 an  ID 
 and  password 
 to allow remote access   
 
 
•   
Checks 
  system status 
 
  
 
 
•

 or  disarms 
  SafeHome 
 system

 and  sensor locations

  video camera locations 
 on ﬂ oor plan 
  
 
 
•   
Selects

  Objects (boldface) and actions (italics) are extracted from this list of  homeowner tasks. The majority of objects noted are application objects. However,  
video cam-era location 
 (a source object) is dragged and dropped onto  
video camera 
 (a target 
object) to create a  video image 
 (a window with video display).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
A preliminary sketch of the screen layout for video monitoring is created  ( Figure 15.3 ).  4 
 
 To invoke the video image, a video camera location icon,  
C, 
 located 
in the ﬂ oor plan displayed in the monitoring window is selected. In this case a 
camera location in the living room (LR) is then dragged and dropped onto the 
video camera icon in the upper left-hand portion of the screen. The video image 
window appears, displaying streaming video from the camera located in the LR. 
The zoom and pan control slides are used to control the magniﬁ cation and direc-
tion of the video image. To select a view from another camera, the user simply 
   Although automated 
tools can be useful 
in developing layout 
prototypes, sometimes 
a pencil and paper are 
all that are needed.   
4  Note that this differs somewhat from the implementation of these features in earlier chapters. 
This might be considered a ﬁ rst draft design and represents one alternative that might be 
considered. pre22126_ch15_317-346.indd   333pre22126_ch15_317-346.indd   33313/12/13   10:01 PM13/12/13   10:01 PM
