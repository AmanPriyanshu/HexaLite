 Interfaces are discussed in Chapter 11. Second, an interface is a collection of operations that specify a service of a class or component. An interface therefore describes the externally visible behavior of that element. An interface might represent the complete behavior of a class or component or only a part of that behavior. An interface defines a set of operation specifications (that is, their signatures) but never a set of operation implementations. Graphically, an interface is rendered as a circle together with its name. An interface rarely stands alone. Rather, it is typically attached to the class or component that realizes the interface, as in Figure 2-2. Figure 2-2 Interfaces  Collaborations are discussed in Chapter 27. Third, a collaboration defines an interaction and is a society of roles and other elements that work together to provide some cooperative behavior that's bigger than the sum of all the elements. Therefore, collaborations have structural, as well as behavioral, dimensions. A given class might participate in several collaborations. These collaborations therefore represent the implementation of patterns that make up a system. Graphically, a collaboration is rendered as an ellipse with dashed lines, usually including only its name, as in Figure 2-3. Figure 2-3 Collaborations
