33.6.8   
An Example of Estimation Using Use Case Points  
The CAD software introduced in Section 33.6.3 is composed of three subsystem groups: user interface subsystem (includes UICF), engineering subsystem group 
(includes the 2DGA, 3DGA, and DAM subsystems), and infrastructure subsystem 
group (includes CGDF and PCF subsystems). Sixteen complex use cases describe 
the user interface subsystem. The engineering subsystem group is described by 
14 average use cases and 8 simple use cases. And the infrastructure subsystem is 

described with 10 simple use cases. Therefore,UUCW 5  (16 use cases 3 15) 1 [(14 use cases 3 10) 1 (8 use cases 3 5)] 1 (10 use cases 3 5) 5 470  Analysis of the use cases indicates that there are 8 simple actors, 12 average actors, and 4 complex actors. Therefore,UAW

Therefore, an estimate of the overall size of the CAD project is 43,600 

LOC. Similar computations can be made for applied effort or project duration.  Using 620 LOC/pm as the average productivity for systems of this type and a burdened labor rate of $8,000 per month, the cost per line of code is approxi-
mately $13. Based on the use-case estimate and the historical productivity data, 
the total estimated project cost is $552,000 and the estimated effort is about 70 
person-months.

Reconciling Estimates  
The estimation techniques discussed in the preceding sections result in multiple es-timates that must be reconciled to produce a single estimate of effort, project dura-
tion, or cost. The total estimated effort for the CAD software (section 33.6.3) ranges 

from a low of 46 person-months (derived using a process-based estimation approach) 

to a high of 68 person-months (derived with use-case estimation). The average esti-
mate (using all four approaches) is 56 person-months. The variation from the average 
estimate is approximately 18 percent on the low side and 21 percent on the high side. 
  What happens when agreement between estimates is poor? The answer to this question requires a reevaluation of information used to make the estimates. 
Widely divergent estimates can often be traced to one of two causes: (1) the scope 
  
 
 uote:  “Complicated 
methods might 
not yield a more 
accurate estimate, 
particularly when 
developers can 
incorporate their 
own intuition into 
the estimate.”  Philip Johnson
