2.  The homeowner uses the keypad to key in a four-digit password. The password is 
compared with the valid password stored in the system. If the password is incor-

rect, the control panel will beep once and reset itself for additional input. If the 
password is correct, the control panel awaits further action.    
 
3.  The homeowner selects and keys in  stay 
 or  
away 
 (see  
Figure 8.1 ) to activate the system.  Stay 
 activates only perimeter sensors (inside motion detecting sensors are 
deactivated).  Away
 
 activates all sensors.    
 
4.  When activation occurs, a red alarm light can be observed by the homeowner. 
  
 
The basic use case presents a high-level story that describes the interaction between the actor and the system.  
 
 
   
In many instances, uses cases are further elaborated to provide considerably more detail about the interaction. For example, Cockburn [Coc01b] suggests the 
following template for detailed descriptions of use cases:   
 
 
 
 
 
 
Use case: 
   
InitiateMonitoring 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
Primary actor: 
 Homeowner. 
   
 
 
 
 
 
Goal in context: 
  To set the system to monitor sensors when the homeowner 
leaves the house or remains inside.    
 
 
 
 
 
Preconditions: 
  System has been programmed for a password and to  recognize various sensors.    
 
 
 
 
 
Trigger:
 
  The homeowner decides to “set” the system, that is, to turn on the alarm functions.     Use cases are often 
written informally. 

However, use the 

template shown here 
to ensure that you’ve 
addressed all key 
issues. 123456789*0offSAFEHOMEawaystay
