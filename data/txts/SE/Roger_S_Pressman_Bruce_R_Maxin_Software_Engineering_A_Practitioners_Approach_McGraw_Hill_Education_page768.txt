An Example of FP-Based Estimation  
Decomposition for FP-based estimation focuses on information domain values rather than software functions. Referring to the table presented in   
Figure 33.3  
, you would estimate inputs, outputs, inquiries, ﬁ les, and external interfaces for 
the CAD software. An FP value is computed using the technique discussed in 
Chapter 30. For the purposes of this estimate, the complexity weighting factor is 
assumed to be average.   
Figure 33.3  
 presents the results of this estimate.  
 
 
 
  Each of the complexity weighting factors is estimated, and the value adjust-ment factor is computed as described in Chapter 30: FactorValue

Vinod (nodding):  Okay, but we haven’t deﬁ
 ned any 
increments yet.   
Doug:  True, but that’s why we need to estimate. 
  
Jamie (frowning):  You want to know how long it’s 
going to take us?   
Doug:  Here’s what I need. First, we need to function-
ally decompose the  SafeHome 

  
Jamie:  Whoa! How are we supposed to do that? 
  
Vinod:  I’ve done it on past projects. You begin with 
use cases, determine the functionality required to im-

plement each, then guesstimate the LOC count for each 
piece of the function. The best approach is to have ev-
eryone do it independently and then compare results. 
  
Doug:  Or you can do a functional decomposition for 
the entire project.   
Jamie:  But that’ll take forever and we’ve got to get 
started. 
  
Vinod:  
morning, in fact. 
  
Doug:  t expect exactitude, just a 
ballpark idea of what the size of  SafeHome 
 will be.   
Jamie:  I think we should just estimate effors 
all.   
Doug:  We’ll do that too. Then use both estimates as a 
cross-check.   
Vinod:  Let’
