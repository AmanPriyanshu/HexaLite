PROJECT SCHEDULING 763

Customer reaction 
 to the concept solicits feedback on a new technology concept and targets speciﬁ c customer applications. 
 
 
  A quick scan of these tasks should yield few surprises. In fact, the software engineering ﬂ ow for concept development projects (and for all other types of 
projects as well) is little more than common sense.   
 
 
34.3.2    
Reﬁ nement of Major Tasks 
 
The major tasks (i.e., software engineering actions) described in the preceding section may be used to deﬁ ne a macroscopic schedule for a project. However, 
the macroscopic schedule must be reﬁ ned to create a detailed project schedule. 
Reﬁ nement begins by taking each major task and decomposing it into a set of 
subtasks (with related work products and milestones).  As an example of task decomposition, consider Task 1.1, Concept Scoping. 
Task reﬁ
 nement can be accomplished using an outline format, but in this book, 
a process design language approach is used to illustrate the ﬂ ow of the concept 
scoping activity:Task deﬁ
 nition: Task 1.1 Concept Scoping
1.1.1 Identify need, beneﬁ
 ts and potential customers;
1.1.2 Deﬁ ne desired output/control and input events that drive the application;
 Begin Task 1.1.2

 1.1.2.1 TR: Review written description of need 
 7 
  1.1.2.2 Derive a list of customer visible outputs/inputs

 1.1.2.3 TR: Review outputs/inputs with customer and revise as required;

 endtask Task 1.1.2

1.1.3 Deﬁ ne the functionality/behavior for each major function;
 Begin Task 1.1.3

 1.1.3.1 TR: Review output and input data objects derived in task 1.1.2;

 1.1.3.2 Derive a model of functions/behaviors;

 1.1.3.3 TR: Review functions/behaviors with customer and revise as required;

 endtask Task 1.1.3

1.1.4 Isolate those elements of the technology to be implemented in software;

1.1.5 Research availability of existing software;

1.1.6 Deﬁ ne technical feasibility;
1.1.7 Make quick estimate of size;

1.1.8 Create a Scope Deﬁ
 nition;
endtask deﬁ nition: Task 1.1 
 
 
 
 
The tasks and subtasks noted in the process design language reﬁ nement form 
the basis for a detailed schedule for the concept scoping activity. 
  
7.  TR indicates that a technical review (Chapter 20) is to be conducted.
