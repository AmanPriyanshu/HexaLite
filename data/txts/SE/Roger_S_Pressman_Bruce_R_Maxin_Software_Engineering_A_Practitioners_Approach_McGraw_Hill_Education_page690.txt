Number of internal logical ﬁ les (ILFs).
  Each  
internal logical ﬁ le  is a logi-
cal grouping of data that resides within the application’s boundary and is 

maintained via external inputs.  

        
Number of external interface ﬁ les (EIFs).
  Each  
external interface ﬁ le  is a 
logical grouping of data that resides external to the application but pro-
vides data that may be of use to the application.    
 Once these data have been collected, the table in   Figure 30.1   is completed and a complexity value is associated with each count. Organizations that use func-
tion point methods develop criteria for determining whether a particular entry 
is simple, average, or complex. Nonetheless, the determination of complexity is 
somewhat subjective.  
 To compute function points (FP), the following relationship is used:
FP 5 count total 3 [0.65 1 0.01 3 S( F  

i )] (30.1)where count total is the sum of all FP entries obtained from   Figure 30.1  . 
 The  F  

i  ( i  
5 1 to 14) are  value adjustment factors  (VAF) based on responses to the 
following questions [Lon02]:     
     
 1.  Does the system require reliable backup and recovery?  
   
 2.  Are specialized data communications required to transfer information to 
or from the application?  
   
 3.  Are there distributed processing functions?  
   
 4.  Is performance critical?  
   
 5.  Will the system run in an existing, heavily utilized operational 

environment?  
   
 6.  Does the system require online data entry?  
   
 7.  Does the online data entry require the input transaction to be built over 
multiple screens or operations?  
   
 8.  Are the ILFs updated online?  
   Value adjustment 

factors are used to 
provide an indication of 
problem complexity.
