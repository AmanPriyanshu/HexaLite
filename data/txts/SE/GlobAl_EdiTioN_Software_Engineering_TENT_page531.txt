3. PUT is used to update the value of a resource.
4. DELETE is used to delete the resource.All services, in some way, operate on data. For example, the service described in 
Section 18.
2 that returns the maximum and minimum temperatures for a location on a given data uses a weather information database. SOAP-based services execute 

actions on this database to return particular values from it. RESTful services 

(Richardson and Ruby 2007) access the data directly.
When a RESTful approach is used, the data is exposed and is accessed using its 
URL. RESTful services use http or https protocols, with the only allowed actions 

being POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE. Therefore, the weather data for each place in 

the database might be accessed using URLs such as:http://weather-info-example.net/temperatures/boston

http://weather-info-example.net/temperatures/edinburgh
This would invoke the GET operation and return a list of maximum and minimum 
temperatures. To request the temperatures for a specific date, a URL query can be used:
http://weather-info-example.net/temperatures/edinburgh?date=20140226

URL queries can also be used to disambiguate the request, given that there may 
be several places in the world with the same name:
http://weather-info-example.net/temperatures/boston?date=20140226&country=
USA&state=ﬁMassﬂAn important difference between RESTful services and SOAP-based services is 
that RESTful services are not exclusively XML-based. So, when a resource is 
requested, created, or changed, the representation may be specified. This is impor
-tant for RESTful services because representations such as JSON (Javascript Object 

Notation), as well as XML, may be used. These can be processed more efficiently 

than XML-based notations, thus reducing the overhead involved in a service call. 

Therefore, the above request for maximum and minimum temperatures for Boston 

may return the following information:
{ﬁplaceﬂ: ﬁBostonﬂ,

ﬁcountry  ﬁUSAﬂ,

ﬁstateﬂ: ﬁMassﬂ,

ﬁdateﬂ: ﬁ26 Feb 2014ﬂ,

ﬁunitsﬂ: ﬁFahrenheitﬂ,

ﬁmax tempﬂ: 41,
ﬁmin tempﬂ: 29
}The response to a GET request in a RESTful service may include URLs. 
Therefore, if the response to a request is a set of resources, then the URL of each of
