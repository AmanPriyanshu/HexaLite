Auditing and Reporting  
In the interest of agility, the auditing and reporting functions are deemphasized 
during the development of Web or MobileApps.

 However, they are not elimi-
nated altogether. All objects that are checked into or out of the repository are 

recorded in a log that can be reviewed at any point in time. A complete log report 
can be created so that all members of the team have a chronology of changes 
over a deﬁ ned period of time. In addition, an automated e-mail notiﬁ
 cation (ad-
dressed to those developers and stakeholders who have interest) can be sent 
every time an object is checked in or out of the repository. 
  
 
12  This is beginning to change. There is an increasing emphasis on SCM as one element of ap-
plication security [Sar06]. By providing a mechanism for tracking and reporting every change 
made to every application object, a change management tool can provide valuable protection 
against malicious changes.
