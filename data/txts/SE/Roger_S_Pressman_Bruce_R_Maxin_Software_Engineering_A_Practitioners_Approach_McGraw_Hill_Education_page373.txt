CHAPTER 15  
USER INTERFACE DESIGN
 343(e.g., 80 percent of all users did not like the mechanism for saving data ﬁ les). 
Design modiﬁ cations are made based on user input, and the next level prototype 
is created. The evaluation cycle continues until no further modiﬁ cations to the 
interface design are necessary. 
 
 
 
 
 
   
The prototyping approach is effective, but is it possible to evaluate the qual-ity of a user interface before a prototype is built?  9 
 
 If you identify and correct 
 potential problems early, the number of loops through the evaluation cycle will 
be reduced and development time will shorten. If a design model of the interface 
has been created, a number of evaluation criteria [Mor81] can be applied during 
early design reviews:   
 
 1.  The length and complexity of the requirements model or written speciﬁ -cation of the system and its interface provide an indication of the amount 
of learning required by users of the system.     
 2.  The number of user tasks speciﬁ ed and the average number of actions per 
task provide an indication of interaction time and the overall efﬁ ciency of 
the system.     
 3.  The number of actions, tasks, and system states indicated by the design model imply the memory load on users of the system.  List of user objectivesObjective #1Objective #2

9  Some software engineers prefer to develop a low-ﬁ
 delity mockup of the user interface (UI) 
called a paper prototype to allow stakeholder to test the UI concept before committing any 
programming resources. The process is described here http://www.paperprototyping.com/
