· If these elements represent generic processors and devices, then stereotype them as such. If they are kinds of processors and devices that are part of the vocabulary of your domain, then specify an appropriate stereotype with an icon for each. · As with class modeling, consider the attributes and operations that might apply to each node. For example, Figure 26-5 takes the previous diagram and stereotypes each node. The server is a node stereotyped as a generic processor; the kiosk and the console are nodes stereotyped as special kinds of processors; and the RAID farm is a node stereotyped as a special kind of device. Figure 26-5 Processors and Devices  Note Nodes are probably the most stereotyped building block in the UML. When, as part of systems engineering, you model the deployment view of a software-intensive system, there's great value in providing visual cues that speak to your intended audience. If you are modeling a processor that's a common kind of computer, render it with an icon that looks like that computer. If you are modeling a common device, such as a cellular phone, fax, modem, or camera, render it with an icon that looks like that device.  Modeling the Distribution of Components The semantics of location are discussed in Chapter 23. When you model the topology of a system, it's often useful to visualize or specify the physical distribution of its components across the processors and devices that make up the system. To model the distribution of components, · For each significant component in your system, allocate it to a given node.
