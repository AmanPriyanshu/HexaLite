882 APPENDIX 1  AN INTRODUCTION TO UMLpreheated. The mixing of the dry ingredients can be done in parallel with the 
mixing of the wet ingredients and the preheating of the oven.  
 A  join  is a way of synchronizing concurrent ﬂ ows of control. It is represented 
by a horizontal black bar with two or more incoming arrows and one outgoing 
arrow. The ﬂ ow of control represented by the outgoing arrow cannot begin ex-

ecution until all ﬂ ows represented by incoming arrows have been completed. In 
  
Figure A1.11, we have a join before the action of mixing together the wet and dry 
ingredients. This join indicates that all dry ingredients must be mixed and all wet 
ingredients must be mixed before the two mixtures can be combined. The second 
join in the ﬁ gure indicates that, before the baking of the cake can begin, all ingre-

dients must be mixed together, and the oven must be at the right temperature.  A  decision  node corresponds to a branch in the ﬂ ow of control based on a 
condition. Such a node is displayed as a white triangle with an incoming arrow Find recipeMix dry
