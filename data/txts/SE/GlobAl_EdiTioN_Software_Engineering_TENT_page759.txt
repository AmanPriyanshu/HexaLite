to the system hardware and which can be compiled to efficient code. It is˜widely

assess the level of software development maturity in an organization. It has now 
been superseded by CMMI, but is still widely used.Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE)The term that was invented in the 1980s to describe process of developing software 
using automated tool support. Virtually all software development is now reliant on 
tool support so the term ™CASE is no longer widely used.CASE toolA software tool, such as a design editor or a program debugger, used to support an 
activity in the software development process.CASE workbenchAn integrated set of CASE tools that work together to support a major process 
activity such as software design or configuration management. Now often called a 
programming environment.change managementA process to record, check, analyze, estimate and implement proposed changes to a
