The relationships among the class (HelloWorld), its source code (hello.java), and its object code (HelloWorld.class) are rarely modeled explicitly, although it is sometimes useful to do so to visualize the physical configuration of a system. On the other hand, it is common to visualize the organization of a Web-based system such as this by using component diagrams to model its pages and other executable components. Part II: Basic Structural Modeling   Chapter 4. Classes In this chapter · Classes, attributes, operations, and responsibilities · Modeling the vocabulary of a system · Modeling the distribution of responsibilities in a system · Modeling nonsoftware things · Modeling primitive types · Making quality abstractions Classes are the most important building block of any object-oriented system. A class is a description of a set of objects that share the same attributes, operations, relationships, and semantics. A class implements one or more interfaces. Advanced features of classes are discussed in Chapter 9.
