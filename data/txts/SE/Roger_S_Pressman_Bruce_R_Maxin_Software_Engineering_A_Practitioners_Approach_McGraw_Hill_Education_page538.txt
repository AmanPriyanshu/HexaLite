Simple Loops.   The following set of tests can be applied to simple loops, where  n 
 is the maximum number of allowable passes through the loop.   
 
 
 1.
  Skip the loop entirely. 
  
 
 
 2.
  Only one pass through the loop.   
 
 
 3.
  Two passes through the loop. 
  
 
 
 4.
   
m 
 passes through the loop where  m 
 ,  n. 
 
  
 
  5.   
n 
 2 1,  n, n 
 1 1 passes through the loop.   
 
 
 
Nested Loops.   
If we were to extend the test approach for simple loops to nested loops, the number of possible tests would grow geometrically as the level of nest-
ing increases. This would result in an impractical number of tests. Beizer [Bei90] 
suggests an approach that will help to reduce the number of tests:  
 
 
 1.
  Start at the innermost loop. Set all other loops to minimum values.   
 
 
 2.
  Conduct simple loop tests for the innermost loop while holding the outer loops at their minimum iteration parameter (e.g., loop counter) values. 
Add other tests for out-of-range or excluded values.   
 
 
 3.
  Work outward, conducting tests for the next loop, but keeping all other 
outer loops at minimum values and other nested loops to “typical” values.   
 
 
 4.
  Continue until all loops have been tested.  
 
  
 
 
 
 
Concatenated Loops.   
Concatenated loops can be tested using the approach de-ﬁ ned for simple loops, if each of the loops is independent of the other. However, 
if two loops are concatenated and the loop counter for loop 1 is used as the initial 
value for loop 2, then the loops are not independent. When the loops are not in-
dependent, the approach applied to nested loops is recommended.   
 
 uote:  “Good testers are 
masters at noticing 
‘something funny’ 
and acting on it.”  Brian Marick

tured loops effectively.
