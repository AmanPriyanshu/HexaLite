basic ones. As you gain more experience in applying the UML, you can build on this conceptual model, using more advanced features of the language. Building Blocks of the UML The vocabulary of the UML encompasses three kinds of building blocks: 1. Things 2. Relationships 3. Diagrams Things are the abstractions that are first-class citizens in a model; relationships tie these things together; diagrams group interesting collections of things. Things in the UML   There are four kinds of things in the UML: 1. Structural things 2. Behavioral things 3. Grouping things 4. Annotational things These things are the basic object-oriented building blocks of the UML. You use them to write well-formed models. Structural Things   Structural things are the nouns of UML models. These are the mostly static parts of a model, representing elements that are either conceptual or physical. In all, there are seven kinds of structural things. Classes are discussed in Chapters 4and 9. First, a class is a description of a set of objects that share the same attributes, operations, relationships, and semantics. A class implements one or more interfaces. Graphically, a class is rendered as a rectangle, usually including its name, attributes, and operations, as in Figure 2-1. Figure 2-1 Classes
