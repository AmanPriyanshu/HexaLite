CHAPTER 28  
FORMAL MODELING AND VERIFICATION
 609 
To verify the correctness of this design, entry and exit conditions are added 
as shown in  Figure 28.6 . The entry condition notes that  x 
 must be greater than or 
equal to 0. The exit condition requires that  x 
 remain unchanged and that  
y 
 satisfy 
the expression noted in the ﬁ gure. To prove the design to be correct, it is neces-
sary to prove the conditions  init, loop, cont, yes, 
 and  
exit 
 shown in Figure 28.6 are 
true in all cases. These are sometimes called  subproofs.
 
  
 
 
 
 1.
  The condition  init 
 demands that [ x 
 $ 0 and  y 
 5 0]. Based on the require-ments of the problem, the entry condition is assumed correct.  3 
 
 Therefore, the ﬁ rst part of the  
init 
 condition,  x 
 $ 0, is satisﬁ ed. Referring to the ﬂ
 ow-
chart, the statement immediately preceding the  init 
 condition, sets  y 
 5 0. Therefore, the second part of the  init 
 condition is also satisﬁ ed. Hence,  
init 
 is true.  
  
 
 
 2.
  The  loop 
 condition may be encountered in one of two ways: (1) directly from  init 
 (in this case, the  loop 
 condition is satisﬁ ed directly) or via control 
ﬂ ow that passes through the condition  
cont. 
 Since the  cont 
 condition is identical to the  loop 
 condition,  loop 
 is true regardless of the ﬂ ow path that 
leads to it.     
 
 3.
  The  cont 
 condition is encountered only after the value of  y 
 is incremented by 1. In addition, the control ﬂ ow path that leads to  
cont 
 can be invoked only if the  yes 
 condition is also true. Hence, if ( y 
 1 1) 2 
 #  x 
, it follows that  y 
 2 
 #  x 
. The  cont 
 condition is satisﬁ ed. 
     To prove a design 
correct, you must ﬁ rst 

identify all conditions 
and then prove that 
each takes on an 
appropriate Bollean 
value. These are called 
subproofs.  y := y + 1(y + 1)2  xy := 0sqrtexit: x unchanged and y2  x  (y
