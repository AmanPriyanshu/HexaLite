CHAPTER 9  
REQUIREMENTS MODELING: SCENARIO-BASED METHODS 183 
 
 
9.3.  What is the purpose of domain analysis? How is it related to the concept of require-ments patterns?    
 
9.4.  Is it possible to develop an effective analysis model without developing all four ele-ments shown in  Figure 9.3 ? Explain.    
 
9.5.  The department of public works for a large city has decided to develop a Web-based 
pothole tracking and repair system (PHTRS). A description follows:  
 
 
 
 
 
Citizens can log onto a website and report the location and severity of potholes. As potholes are reported they are logged within a “public works department repair 
system” and are assigned an identifying number, stored by street address, size (on 

a scale of 1 to 10), location (middle, curb, etc.), district (determined from street ad-
dress), and repair priority (determined from the size of the pothole). Work order data 

are associated with each pothole and include pothole location and size, repair crew 
identifying number, number of people on crew, equipment assigned, hours applied 

to repair, hole status (work in progress, repaired, temporary repair, not repaired), 

amount of ﬁ ller material used, and cost of repair (computed from hours applied, 
number of people, material and equipment used). Finally, a damage ﬁ
 le is created 
to hold information about reported damage due to the pothole and includes citizen’s 

name, address, phone number, type of damage, and dollar amount of damage. PHTRS 

is an online system; all queries are to be made interactively. 
  
 
 
Draw a UML use case diagram PHTRS system. You’ll have to make a number of assumptions 
about the manner in which a user interacts with this system.  
 
   
 
9.6.  Write two or three use cases that describe the roles of various actors in the PHTRS 
described in Problem 9.5.    
 
9.7.  Develop an activity diagram for one aspect of PHTRS.    
 
9.8.  Develop a swimlane diagram for one or more aspects of PHTRS.

Use cases can serve as the foundation for all requirements modeling approaches. The sub-ject is discussed at length by Gomaa ( Software Modeling: UML, Use Case, Patterns, and Ar-
chitecture,
 
 Cambridge University Press, 2011), Rosenberg and Stephens (

 Apress, 2007), Denny ( Succeeding with Use Cases: Working Smart to Deliver Quality,

UML modeling techniques that can be applied for both analysis and design are discussed by Dennis and his colleagues ( Systems Analysis and Design with UML Version 2.0,
