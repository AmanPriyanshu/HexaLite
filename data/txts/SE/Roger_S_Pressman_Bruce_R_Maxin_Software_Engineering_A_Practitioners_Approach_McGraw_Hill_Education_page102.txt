In order to illustrate an agile process in a bit more detail, we’ll provide you with an overview of  Extreme Programming
 
 (XP), the most widely used approach to 
agile software development. Although early work on the ideas and methods as-
sociated with XP   
occurred during the late 1980s, the seminal work on the subject has been written by Kent Beck [Bec04a]. A variant of XP, called  
Industrial XP 
 (IXP), reﬁ nes XP and targets the agile process speciﬁ
 cally for use within large 
organizations [Ker05].   
5.4.1 The XP Process 
 
Extreme Programming uses an object-oriented approach (Appendix 2) as its pre-ferred development paradigm and encompasses a set of rules and practices that 
occur within the context of four framework activities: planning, design, coding, 
and testing.  Figure 5.2  illustrates the XP process and notes some of the key ideas 
and tasks that are associated with each framework activity. Key XP activities are 

summarized in the paragraphs that follow. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Planning.   
The planning activity (also called  the planning game 
) begins with   
listening 
—a requirements gathering activity that enables the technical members
