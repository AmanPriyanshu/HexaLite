the presence of people rather than high-speed events, so they only need to be polled 2 or 
3 times per second. I cover the timing requirements for this system in Section 21.3.I have already introduced the stimuli and responses in this alarm system in Figure 21.1. These responses are used as a starting point for the system design. The Observe 
and React pattern is used in this design. There are observer processes associated with 

each type of sensor and reactor processes for each type of reaction. A single analysis 
process checks the data from all of the sensors. The display processes in the pattern 

are combined into a single display process.The most widespread use of real-time embedded software is in control systems. In 
these systems, the software controls the operation of equipment, based on stimuli 
NameEnvironmental ControlDescriptionThe system analyzes information from a set of sensors that 
collect data from the system™s environment. Further 
information may also be collected on the state of the 
actuators that are connected to the system. Based on the 
data from the sensors and actuators, control signals are 
sent to the actuators, which then cause changes to the 
system™s environment. Information about the sensor values 
and the state of the actuators may be displayed.StimuliValues from sensors attached to the system and the state 
of the system actuators.ResponsesControl signals to actuators display information.ProcessesMonitor, Control, Display, Actuator driver, Actuator monitor.Used inControl systems.Figure 21.9 The Environmental
