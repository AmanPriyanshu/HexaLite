 Note Unless it's obvious by its content, it's good practice to name any extra compartment explicitly so that there is no confusion about its meaning. It's also good practice to use extra compartments sparingly, because if overused, they make diagrams cluttered.  Stereotypes These four basic elements of the UML are discussed in Chapter 2. The UML provides a language for structural things, behavioral things, grouping things, and notational things. These four basic kinds of things address the overwhelming majority of the systems you'll need to model. However, sometimes you'll want to introduce new things that speak the vocabulary of your domain and look like primitive building blocks. TheRational Unified Process is summarized in Appendix C. A stereotype is not the same as a parent class in a parent/child generalization relationship. Rather, you can think of a stereotype as a metatype, because each one creates the equivalent of a new class in the UML's metamodel. For example, if you are modeling a business process, you'll want to introduce things like workers, documents, and policies. Similarly, if you are following a development process, such as the Rational Unified Process, you'll want to model using boundary, control, and entity classes. This is where the real value of stereotypes comes in. When you stereotype an element such as a node or a class, you are in effect extending the UML by creating a new building block just like an existing one but with its own special properties (each stereotype may provide its own set of tagged values), semantics (each stereotype may provide its own constraints), and notation (each stereotype may provide its own icon).
