Load Testing 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The intent of load testing is to determine how the WebApp and its server-side en-
vironment will respond to various loading conditions. As testing proceeds, per-

mutations to the following variables deﬁ ne a set of test conditions:
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
N, 
 number of concurrent users    
 
 
 
 
 
T, 
 number of online transactions per unit of time    
 
 
 
 
 
D, 
 data load processed by the server per transaction  
 
  In every case, these variables are deﬁ ned within normal operating bounds of 
the system. As each test condition is run, one or more of the following measures 
are collected: average user response, average time to download a standardized 
unit of data, or average time to process a transaction. You should examine these 

measures to determine whether a precipitous decrease in performance can be 
traced to a speciﬁ c combination of  
N, T,
 
 and  D. 
  Load testing can also be used to assess recommended connection speeds for users of the WebApp. Overall throughput,  
P, 
 is computed in the following manner:
 P 5 N 
 3  T 
 3  D 
  As an example, consider a popular sports news site. At a given moment, 20,000 concurrent users submit a request (a transaction,  T 
) once every 2 minutes on average. Each transaction requires the WebApp to download a new article that 

averages 3K bytes in length. Therefore, throughput can be calculated as: P 
 5 [20,000 3 0.5 3 3Kb]/60 5 500 Kbytes/sec 5 4 megabits per second  The network connection for the server would therefore have to support this data rate and should be tested to ensure that it does.   
 
 
25.9.3   
Stress Testing 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stress testing
 
 is a continuation of load testing, but in this instance the variables, 
 N, T,
 
 and  
D 
 are forced to meet and then exceed operational limits. The intent of 
these tests is to answer each of the following questions:  
 
 
•  Does the system degrade “gently,” or does the server shut down as capac-
ity is exceeded?   
 
 
•  Does server software generate “server not available” messages? More generally, are users aware that they cannot reach the server? 
  
 
 
•  Does the server queue resource requests and empty the queue once ca-pacity demands diminish?   
 
 
•  Are transactions lost as capacity is exceeded?   
 
 
•  Is data integrity affected as capacity is exceeded?     If a WebApp uses 
multiple servers to 

provide signiﬁ cant 

capacity, load testing 

must be performed 

in a multiserver 

environment.    The intent of stress 

testing is to better 
understand how a 
system fails as it is 
stressed beyond its 
operational limits. pre22126_ch25_540-566.indd   562pre22126_ch25_540-566.indd   56213/12/13   6:15 PM13/12/13   6:15 PM
