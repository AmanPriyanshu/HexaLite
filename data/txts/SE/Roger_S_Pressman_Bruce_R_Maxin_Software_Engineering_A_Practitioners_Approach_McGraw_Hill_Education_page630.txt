27.10.  Compute the annual loss expectancy (ALE) for the loss of a data server whose re-placement value is $30,000, the occurrence of loss of data due to hacking is 5 percent annu-
ally, and the potential loss is $20,000.

 Addison-Wesley, 2006), and Dowd and his colleagues 
( The Art of Software Assessment: Identifying and Preventing Software Vulnerabilities,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 2006) address important security issues. Zalewski ( 
The Tangled Web: A 
Guide to Securing Modern Web Applications,
 
 No Starch Press, 2011) and Howard and LeBlanc 
( Writing Secure Code,
 
 2nd ed., Microsoft Press, 2003) discuss how to construct secure sys-
tems. A project manager’s view is presented by Allen et al. ( 
Software Security Engineering,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 2008). Howard and Lipner ( 
The Security Development Lifecycle, 
 Microsoft 
Press, 2006) discuss the security engineering process. Schumacher et al. ( Security Patterns, 
 Wiley, 2006) provide insight into the use of patterns as one element of effective security 

engineering.   
 
Others focus on the “break-in” side. Books by Barnett and Grossan ( Web Application 
Defender’s Cookbook: Battling Hackers and Protecting Users,
 
 Wiley, 2012), Ottenheimer and 
Wallace ( 
Securing the Virtual Environment: How to Defend Against Enterprise Attack

2012), Studdard and Pinto ( The Web Application Hacker’s Handbook,
 
 Wiley, 2011), Howard 
and his colleagues ( 24 Deadly Sins of Software Security,
 
 McGraw-Hill, 2009), Erickson 
( Hacking: The Art of Exploration, 
 No Starch Press, 2008), Andrews and Whittaker ( 
How to Break Web Software,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 2006), Whittaker ( 
How to Break Software Security,
 
 Addison-Wesley, 2003), provide useful insight for software engineers who need to under-

stand how to attack systems and applications.   
 
Sikorski and Honig ( Practical Malware Analysis,
 
 No Starch Press, 2012) and Ligh et al. 
( Malware Analyst’s Cookbook,
 
 Wiley, 2010) provide excellent insight into the inner working 
of malware. Swiderski ( Threat Modeling,
 
 Microsoft Press, 2004) presents a detailed discus-
sion of threat modeling.   
 
Guidelines for those who must conduct security testing are provided in books by Allen ( Advanced Penetration Testing for Highly Secured Environments,
 
 Packt Publishing, 2012), 
O’Gorman ( Metaspoit: The Penetration Tester’s Guide,
 
 No Starch Press, 2011), Faircloth
