domain, such as events and divisions. As Figure 6-9 shows, there are two things that stand out#Coach objects and Team objects. These are not just plain kinds of classes. Rather, they are now primitive building blocks that you can use in this context. You can create these new building blocks by defining a coach and team stereotype and applying them to UML's classes. In this figure, the anonymous instances called :Coach and :Team (the latter shown in various states#namely, unregistered, registered, and finished) appear using the icons associated with these stereotypes. Figure 6-9 Modeling New Building Blocks.  Modeling New Properties The basic properties of the UML's building blocks#attributes and operations for classes, the contents of packages, and so on#are generic enough to address most of the things you'll want to model. However, if you want to extend the properties of these basic building blocks (or the new building blocks you create using stereotypes), you need to use tagged values. To model new properties, · First, make sure there's not already a way to express what you want by using basic UML. If you have a common modeling problem, chances are that there's already some standard tagged value that will do what you want. · If you're convinced there's no other way to express these semantics, add this new property to an individual element or a stereotype. The rules of generalization apply#tagged values defined for one kind of element apply to its children. Subsystems are discussed in Chapter 31.
