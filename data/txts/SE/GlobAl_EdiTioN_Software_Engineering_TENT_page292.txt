˜These broader systems are called sociotechnical systems. They include nontech-nical elements such as people, processes, and regulations, as well as technical 
 components such as computers, software, and other equipment. System  dependability is influenced by all of the elements in a sociotechnical systemŠhardware, software, people, and organizations.Sociotechnical systems are so complex that it is impossible to understand them as a whole. Rather, you have to view them as layers, as shown in Figure 10.3. These 
layers make up the sociotechnical systems stack:1. The equipment layer is composed of hardware devices, some of which may be computers.2. The operating system layer interacts with the hardware and provides a set of 

common facilities for higher software layers in the system.3. The communications and data management layer 
extends the operating system 

facilities and provides an interface that allows interaction with more extensive 
functionality, such as access to remote systems and access to a system database. 
This is sometimes called middleware, as it is in between the application and the 
operating system.4. The application layer delivers the application-specific functionality that is 

required. There may be many different application programs in this layer.5. The business process layer includes the organizational business processes, 

which make use of the software system.6. The organizational layer includes higher-level strategic processes as well as 

business rules, policies, and norms that should be followed when using the 
 system.7. The social layer refers to the laws and regulations of society that govern the 

operation of the system.EquipmentOperating systemCommunications and data managementApplication systemBusiness processesOrganizationSocietySystems
