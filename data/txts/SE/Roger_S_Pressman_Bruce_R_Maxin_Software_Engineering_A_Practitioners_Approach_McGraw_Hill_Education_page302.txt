 component produces output when an alarm is detected.   
 
 
13.6.4  Describing Instantiations of the System 
 
The architectural design that has been modeled to this point is still relatively high level. The context of the system has been represented, archetypes that indi-
cate the important abstractions within the problem domain have been deﬁ ned, 
the overall structure of the system is apparent, and the major software compo-
nents have been identiﬁ ed. However, further reﬁ
 nement (recall that all design is 
iterative) is still necessary. 
 To accomplish this, an actual instantiation of the architecture is developed. By 
this we mean that the architecture is applied to a speciﬁ c problem with the intent 
of demonstrating that the structure and components are appropriate.   
Figure 13.9  illustrates an instantiation of the  
SafeHome 
 architecture for the 
security system. Components shown in  Figure 13.8  are elaborated to show addi-
tional detail. For example, the  detector management
