CHAPTER 9  
REQUIREMENTS MODELING: SCENARIO-BASED METHODS 179 
 
In many cases, there is no need to create a graphical representation of a 
usage scenario. However, diagrammatic representation can facilitate under-

standing, particularly when the scenario is complex. As we noted earlier in this 

book, UML does provide use case diagramming capability.  
Figure 9.4  depicts 
a preliminary use case diagram for the  SafeHome 
 product. Each use case is 
represented by an oval. Only the  ACS-DCV 
 use case has been discussed in this 
section. 
  Every modeling notation has limitations, and the use case is no exception. Like any other form of written description, a use case is only as good as its author(s). 
If the description is unclear, the use case can be misleading or ambiguous. A use 

case focuses on function and behavioral requirements and is generally inappro-
priate for nonfunctional requirements. For situations in which the requirements 
model must have signiﬁ cant detail and precision (e.g., safety critical systems), a 
use case may not be sufﬁ cient. 
 However, scenario-based modeling is appropriate for a signiﬁ
 cant majority of 
all situations that you will encounter as a software engineer. If developed prop-

erly, the use case can provide substantial beneﬁ
 t as a modeling tool.

ODELS THAT
 SUPPLEMENT THE USE CASE  
 
There are many requirements modeling situations in which a text-based model—even one as simple as a use case—may not impart information in a clear and con-
cise manner. In such cases, you can choose from a broad array of UML graphical 

models.  WebRef
