 Section 1.2  Threats 
11  different meanings. For example, if we say that we have preserved the integrity of an 
item, we may mean that the item is• precise• accurate
• unmodified

• modified only in acceptable ways

• modified only by authorized people

• modified only by authorized processes

• consistent
• internally consistent

• meaningful and usable
Integrity can also mean two or more of these properties. Welke and Mayfield recog-
nize three particular aspects of integrity—authorized actions, separation and protection 

of resources, and error detection and correction. Integrity can be enforced in much the 

same way as can confidentiality: by rigorous control of who or what can access which 

resources in what ways. 
Availability
A computer user’s worst nightmare: You turn on the switch and the computer does noth-

ing. Your data and programs are presumably still there, but you cannot get at them. For-

tunately, few of us experience that failure. Many of us do experience overload, however: 

access gets slower and slower; the computer responds but not in a way we consider 

normal or acceptable. Availability applies both to data and to services (that is, to information and to infor-
mation processing), and it is similarly complex. As with the notion of confidentiality, 

different people expect availability to mean different things. For example, an object or 

service is thought to be available if the following are true:
• It is present in a usable form.
• It has enough capacity to meet the service’s needs.

• It is making clear progress, and, if in wait mode, it has a bounded waiting time.

• The service is completed in an acceptable period of time.
We can construct an overall description of availability by combining these goals. 
Following are some criteria to define availability.
• There is a timely response to our request.
• Resources are allocated fairly so that some requesters are not favored over 
others.• Concurrency is controlled; that is, simultaneous access, deadlock management, 
and exclusive access are supported as required.
