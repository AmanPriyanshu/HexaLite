 Section 6.6  Cryptography in Network Security 
447  IPsec have been published and extensively scrutinized. Work on the protocols began 
in 1992. They were first published in 1995, and they were finalized in 1998 (RFCs 

2401–2409) [KEN98]. A second version of IKE was standardized in 2005 [KAU05] 

and extensions were documented in 2008 [BLA08], although the basic IKE structure 

from 1995 remains. IKE and IPsec include an encrypted nonce specifically to thwart 

hijacking.Virtual Private Networks
Link encryption can give a network’s users the sense that they are on a private net-

work, even when it is part of a pub-

lic network. Furthermore, applied 

at the link level, the encrypting and 

decrypting are invisible to users. For 

this reason, the approach is called a 
virtual private network
 (or VPN). Typically, physical security and administrative security are strong enough to protect 
transmission inside the perimeter of a site (an office, building, plant, or campus, for 

example). Thus, the greatest exposure for a user occurs when communications leave 

the protected environment. Link encryption between two secured endpoints can achieve 

this result.For virtual private networks we consider two cases. In the first, a company has two 
physically separated offices, and the employees want to work as a single unit, exchang-

ing sensitive data as if they were in one protected office. Each office maintains its own 

network. The two offices could implement a private network by acquiring, managing,
