 Section 5.2  Security in the Design of Operating Systems 
319  (as well as work in other countries), 
engendering a truly international 

approach to trusted computer sys-
tems, depicted in the timeline of 

Figure 5-16.The 1980s and 1990s saw several candidates for evaluating the degree of a systemâ€™s 
trustedness, and these approaches converged between 1995 and 2003 in an international 

process for evaluation, called the Common Criteria for Information Technology Secu-

rity Evaluation. Today, thanks to that standard, the market has many products whose 

trustworthiness has been independently confirmed. 
In the next section we examine the functions important to a trusted system. Then, 
in the following section, we briefly describe the current trusted system evaluation and 

certification process.
Trusted System Functions
Trusted systems contain certain functions to ensure security. In this section we look 

over several aspects of a trusted system, starting with the trusted computing base.
Trusted Computing Base (TCB)
The trusted computing base, or TCB, is the name we give to everything in the trusted 
operating system that is necessary to 
enforce the security policy. Alterna-

tively, we say that the TCB consists 

of the parts of the trusted operating 
system on which we depend for cor-

rect enforcement of policy.
