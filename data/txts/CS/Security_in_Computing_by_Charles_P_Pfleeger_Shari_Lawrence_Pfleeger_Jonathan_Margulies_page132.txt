to snoop on encrypted data. Much of this controversy has appeared in the open litera-
ture, but certain DES features have neither been revealed by the designers nor inferred 

by outside analysts.Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman [DIF77] argued in 1977 that a 56-bit key is too 
short. In 1977, it was prohibitive to test all 256 (approximately 10
15) keys on then cur-
rent computers. But they argued that over time, computers would become more power-

ful and the DES algorithm would remain unchanged; eventually, the speed of computers 

would exceed the strength of DES. Exactly that happened about 20 years later. In 1997, 

researchers using a network of over 3,500 machines in parallel were able to infer a DES 

key in four months’ work. And in 1998 for approximately $200,000 U.S. researchers 

built a special “DES cracker” machine that could find a DES key in approximately four 

days, a result later improved to a few hours [EFF98].
Does this mean DES is insecure? No, not exactly. No one has yet shown serious 
flaws in the DES algorithm itself. The 1997 attack required a great deal of coopera-

tion, and the 1998 machine is rather expensive. But even if conventional DES can be 

attacked, triple DES is still well beyond the power of these attacks. Remember the 

impact of exponential growth: Let us say, for simplicity, that single-key DES can be 

broken in one hour. The simple double-key version could then be broken in two hours. 

But 280/256  224, which is over 16,700,000, meaning it would take 16 million hours, 
nearly 2,000 years, to defeat a two-key triple DES encryption, and considerably longer 

for the three-key version.
Nevertheless, the basic structure of DES with its fixed-length 56-bit key and fixed 
number of iterations makes evident the need for a new, stronger, and more flexible algo-

rithm. In 1995, the NIST began the search for a new, strong encryption algorithm. The 

response to that search has become the Advanced Encryption Standard, or AES.
AES: Advanced Encryption SystemAfter a public competition and review, NIST selected an algorithm named Rijndael 

as the new advanced encryption system; Rijndael is now known more widely as AES. 

AES was adopted for use by the U.S. government in December 2001 and became Fed-

eral Information Processing Standard 197 [NIS01]. AES is likely to be the commer-

cial-grade symmetric algorithm of choice for years, if not decades. Let us look at it 

more closely.
Overview of RijndaelRijndael is a fast algorithm that can easily be implemented on simple processors. 
Although it has a strong mathematical foundation, it primarily uses substitution, trans-
position, the shift, exclusive OR, and addition operations. Like DES, AES uses repeat 

cycles. 
There are 10, 12, or 14 cycles for keys of 128, 192, and 256 bits, respectively. In 
Rijndael, the cycles are called “rounds.” Each round consists of four steps that substitute 

and scramble bits. Bits from the key are frequently combined with intermediate result 

bits, so key bits are also well diffused throughout the result. Furthermore, these four 

steps are extremely fast. The AES algorithm is depicted in Figure 2-22.
