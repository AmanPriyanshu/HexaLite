Details of CryptographyDetailed Description of the Encryption AlgorithmThe RSA algorithm uses two keys, 
d and e, which work in pairs, for decryption and 
encryption, respectively. A plaintext message 
P is encrypted to ciphertext 
C byC  Pe mod nThe plaintext is recovered by
P  Cd mod nBecause of symmetry in modular arithmetic C, encryption and decryption are mutual inverses and commutative. Therefore,
P  Cd mod n(Pe)d mod n(Pd)e mod nThis relationship means that one can apply the encrypting transformation and then the decrypting one, or the decrypting one followed by the encrypting one.
Deriving a Key PairThe encryption key consists of the pair of integers (
e, n), and the decryption key is 
(d, n). The starting point in finding keys for this algorithm is selection of a value for 
n. The value of 
n should be quite large, a product of two primes 
p and 
q. Both p and 
q should be large themselves. Typically, 
p and 
q are nearly 100 digits each, so 
n is 
approximately 200 decimal digits (about 512 bits) long; depending on the application, 
768, 1024, or more bits may be more appropriate. A large value of 
n effectively inhibits 
factoring 
n to infer 
p and 
q (but time to encrypt increases as the value of 
n grows larger).
Next, a relatively large integer 
e is chosen so that 
e is relatively prime to (
p − 1) 
 (q − 1). (Recall that “relatively prime” means that 
e has no factors in common with 
(p − 1) 
 (q − 1).) An easy way to guarantee that 
e is relatively prime to (
p − 1) 
 (q − 1) 
is to choose e as a prime that is larger than both (
p − 1) and (q − 1).Finally, select 
d such thate  d 1 mod (p − 1)  (q − 1)ExampleLet p  11 and 
q  12, so that 
n  p q  143 and 
j(n)  (p − 1) (q − 1)  10 12  120. Next, an integer 
e is needed, and 
e must be relatively prime to (
p − 1) (q − 1). Choose e  11.The inverse of 11 mod 120 is also 11, since 11 
 11 
 121  1 mod 120. Thus, both 
encryption and decryption keys are the same: 
e  d  11. (For the example, 
e  d is 
not a problem, but in a real application you would want to choose values where 
e is not equal to d.)Let P be a “message” to be encrypted. For this example we use 
P  7. The message 
is encrypted as follows: 7
11 mod 143  106, so that 
E(7)  106. (Note: This result can 
be computed fairly easily with the use of a common pocket calculator. 7
