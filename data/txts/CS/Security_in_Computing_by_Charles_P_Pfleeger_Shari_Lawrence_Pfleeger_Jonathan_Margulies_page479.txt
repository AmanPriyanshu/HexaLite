 Section 6.6  Cryptography in Network Security 
445  • authentication protocol and key
• life span of the association, to permit long-running sessions to select a new cryp-
tographic key as often as needed
• address of the opposite end of association

• sensitivity level of protected data (usable for classified data)
A host, such as a network server or a firewall, might have several security associa-
tions in effect for concurrent communications with different remote clients. A security 

association is selected by a security parameter index (SPI), a data element that is essen-

tially a pointer into a table of security associations.Headers and DataThe fundamental data structures of IPsec are the authentication header (AH) and the encapsulated security payload (ESP). The ESP replaces (includes) the conventional 
TCP header and data portion of a packet, as shown in Figure 6-45. The physical header 

and trailer depend on the data link and physical layer communications medium, such 
as Ethernet.The ESP contains both an authenticated portion and an encrypted portion, as shown 
in Figure 6-46. The sequence number is incremented by 1 for each packet transmitted 

to the same address using the same security association, to preclude packet replay 

attacks. The payload data are the actual data of the packet. Because some encryption 

or other security mechanisms require blocks of certain sizes, the padding factor and 

padding length fields contain padding and the amount of padding to bring the pay-

load data to an appropriate length. 

The next header indicates the type 

of payload data. The authentication 

field is used for authentication of 

the entire object.PhysicalHeaderPhysicalHeaderIPHeaderIPHeaderTCPHeaderDataPhysicalTrailerPhysicalTrailerESP(includes control, TCP header, and data)FIGURE 6-45 IPsec Encapsulated Security Payload

how to interpret encrypted content.
