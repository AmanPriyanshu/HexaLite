Cloud ComputingSecurity Assertion Markup LanguageTwo prerequisites make FIdM work: trust and standardization. The system that requests 
identity information must trust the data it receives, the system that provides identity 

information must trust the recipient, and those two systems must have a standard way 

to communicate. The 
Security Assertion Markup Language 
(SAML) makes such 
exchanges possible. It is an XML-based standard that defines a way for systems to 

securely exchange user identity and privilege information.
Let’s look at a real-world example of where SAML might come into play. Many 
schools use learning management systems (LMS) such as Blackboard and Canvas to 

help teachers communicate with students. In a typical LMS, each class has a website, 
and students can use that site to submit homework assignments, check their grades, 

download lectures, and chat with one another. LMSs make good candidates for SaaS 

deployment because they do not process extremely sensitive data or require a lot of 

bandwidth. The only potential hurdle is the identity problem: How does the SaaS know 

which users come from which schools? What classes they are enrolled in? Which 

classes they have just dropped? How do they know that the person claiming to be a 

teacher actually is one?When dealing with hundreds of schools and thousands of students, this sort of iden-
tity challenge needs to be solved in an automated way. Here is a high-level description 

of how SAML allows that to happen: Once a school signs up for the LMS cloud ser-

vice, the provider needs the URL of the school’s SAML identity server. When a stu-

dent tries to access the LMS, the service redirects the student to that identity server to
