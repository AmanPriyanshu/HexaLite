Toolbox: Authentication, Access Control, and Cryptography
However, we cannot rest on our laurels. No one can predict now what limitations 
cryptanalysts might identify in the future. Fortunately, talented cryptologists continue 

to investigate even stronger algorithms that will be able to replace AES when it becomes 

obsolete. At present, AES seems to be a significant improvement over DES, and it can 

be improved in a natural way if necessary. DES is still in widespread use, but AES is 

also widely adopted, particularly for new applications.
Public Key CryptographySo far, we have looked at encryption algorithms from the point of view of making the 

scrambling easy for the sender (so that encryption is fast and simple) and the decryption 

easy for the receiver but not for an intruder. But this functional view of transforming 

plaintext to ciphertext is only part of the picture. We must also figure out how to dis-

tribute encryption keys. We have noted how useful keys can be in deterring an intruder, 

but the key must remain secret for it to be effective. The encryption algorithms we have 

presented so far are called 
symmetric or 
secret-key
 algorithms. The two most widely 
used symmetric algorithms, DES and AES, operate similarly: Two users have copies 

of the same key. One user uses the algorithm to encrypt some plaintext under the key, 

and the other user uses an inverse of the algorithm with the same key to decrypt the 

ciphertext. The crux of this issue is that all the power of the encryption depends on the 

secrecy of the key.
