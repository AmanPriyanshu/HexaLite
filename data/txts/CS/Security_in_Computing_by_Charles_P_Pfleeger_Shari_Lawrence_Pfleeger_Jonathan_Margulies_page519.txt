 Section 6.8  Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems 
485  Adaptive BehaviorBecause of these limitations of humans, an IDS can sometimes be configured to take 
action to block the attack or reduce its impact. Here are some kinds of actions an IDS 
can take:
• Continue to monitor the network.
• Block
 the attack 
by redirecting attack traffic to a monitoring host, discarding the 
traffic, or terminating the session.
• Reconfigure the network
 by bringing other hosts online (to increase capacity) or 
adjusting load balancers.• Adjust performance to slow the attack, for example, by dropping some of the 
incoming traffic.
• Deny access to particular network hosts or services.
• Shut down part of the network.
• Shut down the entire network.
CounterattackA final action that can be taken on a detection of an attack is to mount an offense, to 
strike back. An example of such an attack is described in Sidebar 6-26. Offensive action 

must be taken with great caution for several reasons:
• The apparent attacker may not be the real attacker. Determining the true source 
and sender of Internet traffic is not foolproof. Taking action against the wrong 

party only makes things worse.
• A counterattack can lead to a real-time battle in which both the defenses and 
offenses must be implemented with little time to assess the situation.
• Retaliation in anger is not necessarily well thought out.

• Legality can shift. Measured, necessary action to protect one’s resources is a 
well-established legal principle. Taking offensive action opens one to legal jeop-

ardy, comparable to that of the attacker.
• Provoking the attacker can lead to escalation. The attacker can take the counter-
attack as a challenge.SIDEBAR 6-26 Counter-Counter-Countermeasures?
