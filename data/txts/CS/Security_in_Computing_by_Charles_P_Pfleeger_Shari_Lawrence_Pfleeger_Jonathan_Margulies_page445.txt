that it could get to 10.0.0.0 addresses by going through B; that would be a senseless 

loop, but it does record that B is the closest path to 20.0.0.0 addresses.

Figure 6-27 shows how C takes what it has just learned from B and broadcasts it to 
other routers adjacent to it. In this way, the routers announce their capabilities through-

out the entire network. Over time, the routers share information that details the com-

plete network topology. Each router maintains a table of destinations and next steps, 

so if C had something for the 10.0.0.0 subnetwork, its table would indicate it should 

forward that data stream to B.
