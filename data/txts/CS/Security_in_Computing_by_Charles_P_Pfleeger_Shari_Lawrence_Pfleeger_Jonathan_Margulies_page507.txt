 Section 6.7  Firewalls 
473  The outside world sees only one external address, 173.203.129.90 for the whole 
secured internal network, so outsiders cannot infer the structure of the internal network. 

In fact, outsiders do not know if one communication at one time is from the same inter-

nal host as a later communication, thus shielding individual internal users somewhat. 

Finally, knowing the supposed address of an insider will not help an outsider later: If an 

outsider crafts traffic to the same address at a later time, the firewall will reject the traf-

fic because the senderâ€™s address is no longer in the translation table. Although primarily 

used because of another problem (limited public address numbers), network address 

translation performs a significant security role.
Data Loss Prevention
We conclude this section with one more approach that is similar to a firewall or guard. 

Data loss prevention
 (DLP) refers to a set of technologies designed to detect and pos-
sibly prevent attempts to send data where it is not allowed to go. Typical data of con-

cern are classified documents, proprietary information, and private personal information 

(e.g., social security numbers, credit card numbers). DLP solutions experienced an 

increase in popularity in the wake of the Bradley/Chelsea Manning WikiLeaks scandal, 

in which a member of the U.S. military leaked a trove of classified information to the 

WikiLeaks website, and the Edward Snowden scandal, in which an NSA contractor 

leaked a large number of classified documents to a variety of major news organizations.
