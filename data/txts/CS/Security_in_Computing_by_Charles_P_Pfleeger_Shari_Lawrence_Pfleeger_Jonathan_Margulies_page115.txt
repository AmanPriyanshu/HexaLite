 Section 2.2  Access Control 
81  compartment Art1. The list might also specify Adams-
*-Art1, meaning that Adams can 
access the object from any group in compartment Art1. Likewise, a notation of 
*-Decl-* would mean “any user in group Decl in any compartment.” Different placements of the 

wildcard notation * have the obvious interpretations.
Unix uses a similar approach with user–group–world permissions. Every user 
belongs to a group of related users—students in a common class, workers on a shared 

project, or members of the same department. The access permissions for each object are 

a triple (u,g,w
) in which u is for the access rights of the user, 
g is for other members of 
the group, and w is for all other users in the world.
The access control list can be maintained in sorted order, with 
* sorted as coming 
after all specific names. For example, Adams-Decl-
* would come after all specific com-
partment designations for Adams. The search for access permission continues just until 

the first match. In the protocol, all explicit designations are checked before wild cards 

in any position, so a specific access right would take precedence over a wildcard right.
