The Web—User Side
As another example, security firm f-Secure advised (22 Oct 2010) of a phony ver-
sion of Microsoft’s Security Essentials tool. The real tool locates and eradicates mal-

ware; the phony tool reports phony—nonexistent—malware. An example of its action 

is shown in Figure 4-9. Not surprisingly, the “infections” the phony tool finds can be 

cured only with, you guessed it, phony tools sold through the phony tool’s web site, 

shown in Figure 4-10.
