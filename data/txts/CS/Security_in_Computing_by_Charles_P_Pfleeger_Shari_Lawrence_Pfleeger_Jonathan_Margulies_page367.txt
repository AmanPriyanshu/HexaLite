to remote systems, and forwarding harmful code to email contacts. 
A rootkit runs with privileges and position of an operating system component. It is 
loaded automatically as part of operating system startup and because of its position, 

it can intercept and modify operating system calls and return values, as shown in Fig-

ure 5-23. The operating system performs audit logging, but the rootkit can fail to pass 

on its own activities to be logged. A rootkit is in prime position to remain undiscovered 

and undiscoverable and to perform any action unconstrained.
