Programs and Programminganalyst can determine literally what instructions a piece of code performs, the analyst has a harder time determining the broader intent and impact of those statements.Security research labs do an excellent job of tracking and analyzing malicious code, 
but such analysis is necessarily an operation of small steps with microscope and twee-

zers. (The phrase microscope and 

tweezers is attributed to Jerome 

Saltzer in [EIC89].) Even with 

analysis tools, the process depends 

heavily on human ingenuity. In 

Chapter 10 we expand on teams that 

do incident response and analysis.Storage Patterns Most viruses attach to programs that are stored on media such as disks. The attached 

virus piece is invariant, so the start of the virus code becomes a detectable signature. 

The attached piece is always located at the same position relative to its attached file. 

For example, the virus might always be at the beginning, 400 bytes from the top, 
 or at the bottom of the infected file. Most likely, the virus will be at the beginning of 

the file because the virus writer wants to control execution before the bona fide code 
 of the infected program is in charge. In the simplest case, the virus code sits at the top 

of the program, and the entire virus does its malicious duty before the normal code is 
invoked. In other cases, the virus infection consists of only a handful of instructions that 

point or jump to other, more detailed, instructions elsewhere. For example, the infected 

code may consist of condition testing and a jump or call to a separate virus module. In 
either case, the code to which control is transferred will also have a recognizable pat-

tern. Both of these situations are shown in Figure 3-25.
A virus may attach itself to a file, in which case the file’s size grows. Or the virus 
may obliterate all or part of the underlying program, in which case the program’s size 

does not change but the program’s functioning will be impaired. The virus writer has to 

choose one of these detectable effects.
