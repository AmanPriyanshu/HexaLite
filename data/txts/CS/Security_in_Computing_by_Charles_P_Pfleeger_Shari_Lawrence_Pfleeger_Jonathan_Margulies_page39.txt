5  value. For example, the value of the plans for a company’s new product line is very 
high, especially to competitors. But once the new product is released, the plans’ value 

drops dramatically.
The Vulnerability–Threat–Control Paradigm
The goal of computer security is protecting valuable assets. To study different ways of 

protection, we use a framework that describes how assets may be harmed and how to 

counter or mitigate that harm.A vulnerability is a weakness in the system, for example, in procedures, design, or 
implementation, that might be exploited to cause loss or harm. For instance, a particular 

system may be vulnerable to unau-
thorized data manipulation because 
the system does not verify a user’s 

identity before allowing data access.
A threat
 to a computing system 
is a set of circumstances that has the potential to cause loss or harm. To see the difference 

between a threat and a vulnerability, consider the illustration in Figure 1-4. Here, a wall 

is holding water back. The water to the left of the wall is a threat to the man on the right 

of the wall: The water could rise, overflowing onto the man, or it could stay beneath the 

height of the wall, causing the wall 

to collapse. So the threat of harm is 
the potential for the man to get wet, 
get hurt, or be drowned. For now, 

the wall is intact, so the threat to the 

man is unrealized.A vulnerability is a weakness that could 
be exploited to cause harm.A threat is a set of circumstances that
