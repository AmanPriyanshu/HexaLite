 Section 6.1  Network Concepts 
347  Transmission to the satellite can cover a wide area around the satellite because noth-
ing else is nearby to pick up the signal. On return to earth, however, the wide dissemina-

tion radius, called the broadcast’s footprint, allows any antenna within range to obtain 

the signal without detection, as shown in Figure 6-2. Different satellites have different 

characteristics, but some signals can be intercepted in an area several hundred miles 

wide and a thousand miles long. Therefore, the potential for interception by being in the 

signal’s path is even greater than with microwave signals. However, because satellite 

communications are generally heavily multiplexed, the risk is small that any one com-

munication will be intercepted.In summary, network traffic is available to an interceptor at many points. Figure 6-3 
illustrates how communications are exposed from their origin to their destination. We 

summarize strengths and weaknesses of different communications media in Table 6-1.
From a security standpoint, you 
should assume that all communica-
tion links between network nodes 

can be broken. As Sidebar 6-2 indi-

cates, even eyeballs can pass data 

unintentionally. For this reason, 
FIGURE 6-2 Satellite CommunicationAll network communications are 

potentially exposed to interception; 

thus, sensitive signals must be 
protected.
