 Section 7.4  Database Disclosure 
523  Mean The arithmetic mean (average) allows exact disclosure if the attacker can manipu-
late the subject population. As a trivial example, consider salary. Given the number of 

employees, the mean salary for a company and the mean salary of all employees except 

the president, it is easy to compute the presidentâ€™s salary.
Median By a slightly more complicated process, we can determine an individual value from the 

median, the midpoint of an ordered list of values. The attack requires finding selections 
having one point of intersection that happens to be exactly in the middle, as shown in 

Figure 7-3.For example, in our sample database, there are five males and three persons whose 
drug use value is 2. Arranged in order of aid, these lists are shown in Table 7-10. Notice 

that Majors is the only name common to both lists, and conveniently that name is in the 

middle of each list. Someone working at the Health Clinic might be able to find out that 

Majors is a white male whose drug-use score is 2. That information identifies Majors as
