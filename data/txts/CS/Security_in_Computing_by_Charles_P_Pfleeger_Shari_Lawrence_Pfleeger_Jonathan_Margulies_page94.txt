the data points particular to a specific user. In the second phase the user later seeks 
authentication from the system, during which time the system remeasures the hand and 
compares the new measurements with the stored template. If the new measurement 

is close enough to the template, the system accepts the authentication; otherwise, the 
system rejects it. Sidebar 2-9 points out the problem in confusing identification and 

authentication.SIDEBAR 2-8 Fingerprint Captureâ€”Not So Fast!
Recording or capturing fingerprints should be a straightforward process. 
Some countries use fingerprints to track foreign visitors who enter the 

country, and so they want to know the impact on processing visitors at the 

border. On television and in the movies it seems as if obtaining a good fin-

gerprint image takes only a second or two.Researchers at the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technol-
ogy (NIST) performed a controlled experiment involving over 300 subjects 

generally representative of the U.S. population [THE07]. They found that 

contrary to television, obtaining a quality sample of all ten fingers takes 

between 45 seconds and a minute.FIGURE 2-5 Identification and Authentication (courtesy of Lfoxy/Shutterstock [left]; Schotter
