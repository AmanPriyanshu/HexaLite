Lest you dismiss these results as dated (they were reported in 1979), Klein repeated 
the experiment in 1990 [KLE90] and Spafford in 1992 [SPA92a]. Each collected 

approximately 15,000 passwords. Klein reported that 2.7 percent of the passwords 

were guessed in only 15 minutes of machine time (at the speed of 1990s computers), 
and 21 percent were guessed within a week! Spafford found that the average password 

length was 6.8 characters and that 28.9 percent consisted of only lowercase alphabetic 

characters. Then, in 2002 the British online bank Egg found its users still choosing weak pass-
words [BUX02]. A full 50 percent of passwords for their online banking service were 

family members’ names: 23 percent children’s names, 19 percent a spouse or partner, 

and 9 percent their own. Alas, pets came in at only 8 percent, while celebrities and 

football (soccer) stars tied at 9 percent each. And in 1998, Knight and Hartley [KNI98] 

reported that approximately 35 percent of passwords are deduced from syllables and 

initials of the account owner’s name. In December 2009 the computer security firm 

Imperva analyzed 34 million Facebook passwords that had previously been disclosed 

accidentally, reporting that 
• about 30 per cent of users chose passwords of fewer than seven characters.
• nearly 50 per cent of people used names, slang words, dictionary words or trivial 
passwords—consecutive digits, adjacent keyboard keys and so on.
• most popular passwords included 12345, 123456, 1234567, password, and 
iloveyou, in the top ten.
