 Section 2.3  Cryptography 
111  parity are called even and odd. With even parity the fingerprint is 0 if the sum of the data 
bits is even, and 1 if the sum is odd; that is, the parity bit is set so that the sum of all data 

bits plus the parity bit is even. Odd parity is the same except the overall sum is odd. For 

example, the data stream 01101101 would have an even parity bit of 1 (and an odd parity 

bit of 0) because 01101101  5  1  6 (or 5  0  5 for odd parity).One parity bit can reveal the modification of a single bit. However, parity does not 
detect two-bit errorsâ€”cases in which two bits in a group are changed. One parity bit can 

detect all single-bit changes, as well as changes of three, five and seven bits. Table 2-14 

shows some examples of detected and undetected changes. The changed bits (each line 

shows changes from the original value of 00000000) are in bold, underlined; the table 

shows whether parity properly detected that at least one change occurred.
Detecting odd numbers of changed bits leads to a change detection rate of about 50 percent, which is not nearly good enough for our purposes. We can improve this rate 

with more parity bits (computing a second parity bit of bits 1, 3, 5, and 7, for example), 

but more parity bits increase the size of the fingerprint; each time we increase the fin-

gerprint size we also increase the size of storing these fingerprints.
Parity signals only that a bit has been changed; it does not identify which bit has 
been changed, much less when, how, or by whom. On hardware storage devices, a code 

called a cyclic redundancy
 check detects errors in recording and playback. Some more 
complex codes, known as 
error correction codes
, can detect multiple-bit errors (two or 
more bits changed in a data group) and may be able to pinpoint the changed bits (which 
are the bits to reset to correct the modification). Fingerprint size, error detection rate, 

and correction lead us to more powerful codes.
Hash CodesIn most files, the elements or components of the file are not bound together in any way. 
That is, each byte or bit or character is independent of every other one in the file. This
