 Section 2.3  Cryptography 
125  With these five components we can construct a digital signature.
We start with the file. If we use a secure hash code of the file to compute a message 
digest and include that hash code in the signature, the code demonstrates that the file has 

not been changed. A recipient of the signed file can recompute the hash function and, if 

the hash values match, conclude with reasonable trust that the received file is the same 

one that was signed. So far, our digital signature looks like the object in Figure 2-33.

AuthenticityNext, we apply the signerâ€™s private encryption key to encrypt the message digest. 
Because only the signer knows that key, the signer is the only one who could have 

applied it. Now the signed object looks like Figure 2-34.
