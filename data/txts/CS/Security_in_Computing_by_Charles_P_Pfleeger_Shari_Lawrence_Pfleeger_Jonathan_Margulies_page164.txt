Toolbox: Authentication, Access Control, and Cryptography
23. What property of a hash function means that collisions are not a security problem? That 
is, why can an attacker not capitalize on collisions and change the underlying plaintext to 

another form whose value collides with the hash value of the original plaintext?
24. Does a PKI perform encryption? Explain your answer.
25. Does a PKI use symmetric or asymmetric encryption? Explain your answer.
26. Should a PKI be supported on a firewall (meaning that the certificates would be stored on 
the firewall and the firewall would distribute certificates on demand)? Explain your answer.
27. Why does a PKI need a means to cancel or invalidate certificates? Why is it not sufficient for 
the PKI to stop distributing a certificate after it becomes invalid?
28. Some people think the certificate authority for a PKI should be the government, but others 
think certificate authorities should be private entities, such as banks, corporations, or schools. 

What are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach?
29. If you live in country A and receive a certificate signed by a government certificate authority 
in country B, what conditions would cause you to trust that signature as authentic?
30. A certificate contains an identity, a public key, and signatures attesting that the public key 
belongs to the identity. Other fields that may be present include the organization (for exam-

ple, university, company, or government) to which that identity belongs and perhaps subor-

ganizations (college, department, program, branch, office). What security purpose do these 

other fields serve, if any? Explain your answer.
