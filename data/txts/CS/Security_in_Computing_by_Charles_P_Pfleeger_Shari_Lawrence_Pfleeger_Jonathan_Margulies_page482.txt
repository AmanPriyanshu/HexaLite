Networksand maintaining their own network equipment to provide a private link between the 
two sites. This solution is often costly, and the company assumes full responsibility 

for maintaining the connection. Often such companies are not in the networking busi-

ness, but maintaining that one link requires them to become or hire network administra-

tors. However, the company may not like the risk of communicating sensitive company 

information across a public, shared network.
The alternative is a 
virtual private network
 between the offices. With link encryp-
tion, all communications between the sites are encrypted. Most of the cost of this solu-
tion is in acquiring and setting up the network. Some employee communications will 

involve sensitive plans and confidential data; other communications will be mundane 

office chatter about sports teams or lunch plans. There is almost no harm in encrypting 

the chatter as well as the important traffic because the added time to encrypt and decrypt 

all traffic is usually insignificant relative to the network transmission time.
Firewalls (described in the next section) can implement a VPN. When a user first 
establishes a communication with the firewall, the user can request a VPN session with 

the firewall. The userâ€™s client and the firewall negotiate a session encryption key, and the 

firewall and the client subsequently use that key to encrypt all traffic between the two. 

In this way, the larger network is restricted only to those given special access by the 

VPN. In other words, it feels to the user as if the larger network is private, even though 

it is not. With the VPN, we say that the communication passes through an encrypted 

tunnel. Establishment of a VPN is shown in Figure 6-48.
