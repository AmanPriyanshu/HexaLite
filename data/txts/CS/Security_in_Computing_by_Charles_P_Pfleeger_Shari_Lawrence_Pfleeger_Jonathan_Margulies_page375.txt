• Managing network security, security information, and 
event managementAs we all know, much of computing today involves interacting remotely with 

people, computers, processes, and even wrongdoers. You could hide in your 

room and never pass anything to or receive anything from outside, but that 
would severely limit what you could do. Thus, some degree of external connectivity is 

almost inevitable for most computer users, and so the question becomes how to do that 

with reasonable security.
But as soon as you decide to connect to points outside your security perimeter, that 
connection leaves your zone of protection, and you are at risk that others will read, 

modify, and even obliterate your communication. In this chapter we consider security 

in remote networks. In Chapter 4 we examined the impact of a network on a local user, 

focusing extensively on the browser, the most obvious connection between a user and a 

network. Running on users’ machines, browsers are under the user’s control, although 

we explored numerous situations in which the browser seems to be acting against, not 

for, the user. But in this chapter we move to remote networks, where the user has little 

if any expectation of control, and thus the security risks are great.
