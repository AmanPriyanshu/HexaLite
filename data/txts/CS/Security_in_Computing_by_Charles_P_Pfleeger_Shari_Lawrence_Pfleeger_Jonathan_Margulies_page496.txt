NetworksCircuit-Level Gateway
A circuit-level gateway
 is a firewall that essentially allows one network to be an exten-
sion of another. It operates at OSI level 5, the session level, and it functions as a virtual 

gateway between two networks. A circuit is a logical connection that is maintained for 

a period of time, then torn down or disconnected. The firewall verifies the circuit when 

it is first created. After the circuit has been verified, subsequent data transferred over 

the circuit are not checked. Circuit-level gateways can limit which connections can be 

made through the gateway.
One use for a circuit-level gateway is to implement a virtual private network, described 
earlier in this chapter. Suppose a company has two offices, each with its own network, at 

addresses 100.1.1.x and 200.1.1.x. Furthermore, the company wants to ensure that commu-

nication between these two address spaces is private, so the network administrator installs 

a pair of encryption devices. The circuit-level gateway separates all traffic to and from the 

100 and 200 networks, as shown in Figure 6-57. (This figure shows only the 100 network; 
a parallel structure exists on the 200 network.) The circuit gateway on the 100 network 

routes all traffic to the 200 network through an encryption device. When traffic returns, 

the firewall on the 100 subnetwork routes all traffic from the 200 network through the 

encryption unit (for decryption) and back to the 100 gateway. In this way, traffic flow 

between the 100 and 200 networks is automatically screened (so no other traffic can mas-

querade as part of this pair of protected networks), and encrypted for confidentiality. Users
