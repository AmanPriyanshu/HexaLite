table and learns the concealment algorithm, a computer program can easily test hun-

dreds of thousands of guesses in a matter of minutes.As numerous studies in this chapter confirmed, people often use one of a few pre-
dictable passwords. The interceptor can create what is called a rainbow table, a list of 

the concealed forms of the common passwords, as shown in Table 2-4. Searching for 

matching entries in an intercepted 

password table, the intruder can 

learn that Jan’s password is 123456 

and Mike’s is qwerty. The attacker 

sorts the table to make lookup fast.
Scrambled passwords have yet another vulnerability. Notice in Table 2-2 that Pat and 
Roz both chose the same password. Both copies will have the same concealed value, 

so someone who intercepts the table can learn that users Pat and Roz have the same 

password. Knowing that, the interceptor can also guess that Pat and Roz both chose 

common passwords, and start trying the usual ones; when one works, the other will, too.
To counter both these threats, some systems use an extra piece called the 
salt. A salt 
is an extra data field different for each user, perhaps the date the account was created or 

a part of the user’s name. The salt value is joined to the password before the combination 

is transformed by concealment. In this way, Pat
aaaaaa has a different concealment 
value from Roz
aaaaaa, as shown 
in Table 2-5. Also, an attacker can-

not build a rainbow table because 

the common passwords now all 

have a unique component, too.
