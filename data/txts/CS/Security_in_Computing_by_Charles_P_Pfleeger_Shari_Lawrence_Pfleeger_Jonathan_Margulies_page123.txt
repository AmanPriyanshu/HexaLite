shift each plaintext letter forward 
n positions in the alphabet. For 
n  1, A is changed to 
b, B to c, . . . P to q, . . . and Z to a, so we say the key value is 
n, moving 
n positions for-
ward for encryption and backward for decryption. (You might notice that we have writ-

ten the plaintext in uppercase letters 

and the corresponding ciphertext in 

lowercase; cryptographers some-

times use that convention to help 

them distinguish the two.)
At other times, encryption and decryption keys come in pairs. Then, a decryption 
key, 
KD, inverts the encryption of key 
KE, so that P  D(KD, E(KE,P)). Encryption 
algorithms of this form are called asymmetric or 
public key because converting 
C back to P involves a series of steps 
and a key that are different from the 

steps and key of 
E. The difference 
between symmetric and asymmetric 
encryption is shown in Figure 2-19. 
A key gives us flexibility in using an encryption scheme. We can create different 
encryptions of one plaintext message just by changing the key. Moreover, using a key 

provides additional security. If the encryption algorithm should fall into the intercep-

torâ€™s hands, future messages can still be kept secret because the interceptor will not 

know the key value. Sidebar 2-14 describes how the British dealt with written keys and 

codes in World War II. An encryption scheme that does not require the use of a key is 

called a keyless cipher
.Symmetric encryption: one key encrypts and decrypts.Asymmetric encryption: one key 
encrypts, a different key decrypts.
