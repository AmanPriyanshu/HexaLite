Introduction – (human) guards

• Procedural
 or 
administrative
 controls use a command or agreement that 
 – requires or advises people how to act; for example,

 – laws, regulations

 – policies, procedures, guidelines

 – copyrights, patents

 – contracts, agreements
• Technical controls 
counter threats with technology (hardware or software), 
including
 – passwords

 – program or operating system access controls

 – network protocols

 – firewalls, intrusion detection systems

 – encryption

 – network traffic flow regulators
(Note that the term “logical controls” is also used, but some people use it to mean 
administrative controls, whereas others use it to mean technical controls. To avoid con-

fusion, we do not use that term.)As shown in Figure 1-13, you can think in terms of the property to be protected and 
the kind of threat when you are choosing appropriate types of countermeasures. None 
of these classes is necessarily better than or preferable to the others; they work in dif-

ferent ways with different kinds of results. And it can be effective to use 
overlapping 
controls 
or defense in depth: more than one control or more than one class of control to achieve protection.
