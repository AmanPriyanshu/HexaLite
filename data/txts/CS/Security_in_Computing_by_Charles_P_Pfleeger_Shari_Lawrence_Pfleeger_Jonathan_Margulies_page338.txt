304 Chapter 5  
Operating Systemsthe operating system need only update the address in that one table when a seg-
ment is moved.
• A segment can be removed from main memory (and stored on an auxiliary 
device) if it is not being used currently. (These first two advantages explain why 

this technique is called virtual memory, with the same basis as the virtualization 

described earlier in this chapter. The appearance of memory to the user is not 

necessarily what actually exists.)
• Every address reference passes through the operating system, so there is an 
opportunity to check each one for protection.Because of this last characteristic, a process can access a segment only if that seg-
ment appears in that process’s segment-translation table. The operating system controls 

which programs have entries for a particular segment in their segment address tables. 

This control provides strong pro-

tection of segments from access by 

unpermitted processes. For exam-

ple, program A might have access 

to segments BLUE and GREEN of 

user X but not to other segments of
