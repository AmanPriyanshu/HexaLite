Hello. Can You Hear Me Now? 
How About Now?Mobile telephones are much more complicated than we sometimes imag-
ine. With landline telephony you have essentially one cable connecting your 

phone with the local telephone switching office, so most of the telephone 

is just electronics to convert audio voice to an electronic signal and back 

again. Mobile telephones do that, plus they have to manage the connection 
to the mobile network. Unlike the case with landline communication, as a 
mobile phone moves (and sometimes even when not), the device is con-

stantly looking for a different signal to which to connect.
At the 2010 Defcon 18 conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, security 
researcher Chris Paget demonstrated his own homemade GSM tower, and 

convinced up to 30 unwitting attendees with mobile phones to connect to 
his system. The parts cost approximately $1500, and he used an ordinary 

laptop running an open source application that essentially turned the lap-

top into a GSM base station. A mobile phone will try to associate with the 

strongest signal it can find; proximity helped him meet that goal. Users are 

unaware when a mobile phone establishes or changes its association with 

a provider.
The United States has laws against wiretapping telephone conver-
sations, so Paget was careful to announce his intentions and activity to 

attendees. He also carefully eliminated all traces of the phone calls his 

system handled so as to preserve his customersâ€™ privacy. (Most attackers 

would not be so scrupulously polite, however.) For purposes of the demon-

stration he intercepted only outbound calls and played a warning message 

to the callers.
