Networksuntil they are encrypted just prior to transmission, at level 1. Addressing occurs at 
level 3. Therefore, in the intermediate node, the encryption must be removed in order to 

determine where next to forward the data, and so the content is exposed. 
Encryption protects the message in transit between two computers, but the message 
is in plaintext inside the hosts. (A message in plaintext is said to be “in the clear.”) 

Notice that because the encryption is added at the bottom protocol layer, the message 

is exposed in all other layers of the sender and receiver. If we have good physical secu-

rity and we trust the software that implements the upper-layer functions, we may not 

be too concerned about this potential vulnerability. The message is open to access in 

two layers of all intermediate hosts through which the message may pass. The message 

is in the clear in the intermediate hosts, and one of these hosts may not be especially 

trustworthy.
Link encryption is invisible to the user. The encryption becomes a transmission 
service performed by a low-level network protocol layer, just like message routing or 

transmission error detection. Figure 6-37 shows a typical link-encrypted message, with 

the shaded fields encrypted. Because some of the data link header and trailer is applied 

before the block is encrypted, part of each of those blocks is shaded. As the message M 

is handled at each layer, header and control information is added on the sending side 

and removed on the receiving side. Hardware encryption devices operate quickly and 

reliably; in this case, link encryption is invisible to the operating system as well as to 

the operator.
