 Section 6.7  Firewalls 
471  What Firewalls Can—and Cannot—Block
As we have seen, firewalls are not complete solutions to all computer security problems. 
A firewall protects only the perimeter of its environment against attacks from outsiders 

who want to execute code or access data on the machines in the protected environment. 

Keep in mind these points about firewalls.
• Firewalls can protect an environment only if the firewalls control the entire 
perimeter. That is, firewalls are effective only if no unmediated connections 

breach the perimeter. If even one inside host connects to an outside address, by 

a wireless connection for example, the entire inside net is vulnerable through the 

unprotected host.• Firewalls do not protect data outside the perimeter; data that have properly 
passed (outbound) through the firewall are just as exposed as if there were no 

firewall.
• Firewalls are the most visible part of an installation to the outside, so they are 
the most attractive target for attack. For this reason, several different layers of 

protection, called defense in depth, are better than relying on the strength of just 
a single firewall.
• Firewalls must be correctly configured, that configuration must be updated as 
the internal and external environment changes, and firewall activity reports must 

be reviewed periodically for evidence of attempted or successful intrusion.
