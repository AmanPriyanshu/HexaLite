to identify even simple attack patterns, such as attacks on many stores emanating from 

the same source address. Instead, SiC needs an automated aid to enhance the security 
team’s abilities, and this is where 
security information and event management
, or 
SIEM, tools come into play. SIEMs are software systems that collect security-relevant 
data from a variety of hardware and software products in order to create a unified secu-

rity dashboard (like the image shown in Figure 6-67 for SOC personnel.
Data CollectionModern security products, networking equipment, and operating systems commonly 
report security-relevant data to text-based log files. For instance, when a user enters an 

incorrect password trying to log in to Windows, Windows can write a “logon failure”
