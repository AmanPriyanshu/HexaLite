Networks6.2 THREATS TO NETWORK COMMUNICATIONS
Now we look at security threats in networks. From our description of threats in Chapter 
1 you may remember four potential types of harm:• interception
, or unauthorized viewing
• modification
, or unauthorized change• fabrication, or unauthorized creation• interruption, or preventing authorized access
These four types apply to networks, although the terminology is slightly different. Inter-
ception is sometimes called eavesdropping or wiretapping, modification and fabrication 

are usually known by the more general term integrity failures, and interruption in a 

network is denial of service. Next we consider these network security issues. We also 

discuss port scanning: reconnaissance before an attack.Interception: Eavesdropping and Wiretapping
Security analysts sometimes use the concept of a security perimeter, a virtual line that 

encircles a protected set of computing resources. You might think of a security perim-

eter as encompassing a physical location, such as a home, school, office, or store, as 

shown in Figure 6-6. Of course, these lines do not really exist, and for much network 

use you need to extend your access outside your protected zone. But because you lose 

control of equipment (cables, network devices, servers) outside your zone, your ability 

to secure your data is limited.SecurityperimeterFIGURE 6-6 Security Perimeters
