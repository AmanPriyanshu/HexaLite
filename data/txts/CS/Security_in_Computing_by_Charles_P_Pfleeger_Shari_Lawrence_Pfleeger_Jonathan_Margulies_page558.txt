Databasesthe intersection of these two lists and pinpoints Majors’ financial aid as $2000. In this 
example, the queries
q = median(AID where SEX = M)p = median(AID where DRUGS = 2)reveal the exact financial aid amount for Majors.
Tracker Attacks 
As already explained, database management systems may conceal data when a small 

number of entries make up a large proportion of the data revealed. A 
tracker attack
 can fool the database manager into locating the desired data by using additional queries 
that produce small results. The tracker adds additional records to be retrieved for two 

different queries; the two sets of records cancel each other out, leaving only the statis-

tic or data desired. The approach is to use intelligent padding of two queries. In other 

words, instead of trying to identify a unique value, we request 
n–1 other values (where 
there are n values in the database). Given 
n and n–1, we can easily compute the desired single element.For instance, suppose we want to know how many female Caucasians live in Holmes 
Hall. A query posed might be
count ((SEX=F) ^ (RACE=C) ^ (DORM=Holmes))The database management system might consult the database, find that the answer is 

1, and block the answer to that query because one record dominates the result of the 
query. However, further analysis of the query allows us to track sensitive data through 

nonsensitive queries.
