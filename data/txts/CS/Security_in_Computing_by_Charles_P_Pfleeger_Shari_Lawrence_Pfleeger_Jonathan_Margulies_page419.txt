 Section 6.3  Wireless Network Security 
385  A better protocol design would have been for the access point and the associating 
device to establish a shared data value to be used during this one association only. In 

that way, intercepting the initial authentication request would reveal the SSID, but inter-

cepting any later frame would not.
Authentication in Wireless Networks
Access points can manage lists of MAC addresses of devices with which they will 
accept connections. Thus, authentication in step 2 could be accomplished by accepting 

only devices on the positive accept list.
Changeable MAC Addresses
The operating system doesnâ€™t actually always obtain the hardware MAC address of a 
NIC card, but instead it consults internal data, so changing the MAC address requires 

changing only the network card address table. Instructions for doing that are easy to 

find on the Internet.
