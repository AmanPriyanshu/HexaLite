551In this chapter:• What is a cloud service?
• Risks to consider when choosing cloud services

• Security tools for cloud environments
Cloud computing is not a new technology. Rather, it is a new way of provid-

ing services by using technology. The U.S. National Institute for Standards and 

Technology has proposed defining cloud computing as a model “for enabling 
convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing 

resources.” [MEL11] Thus, the cloud consists of networks, servers, storage, applica-

tions, and services that are connected in a loose and easily reconfigurable way. If you 

want to use the cloud, you contract with a cloud service provider, specify the configura-

tion you want, et voilà! It is provided to you with very little exercise of your gray cells!
8.1 CLOUD COMPUTING CONCEPTS
The cloud has five defining characteristics:
• On-demand self-service. If you are a cloud customer, you can automatically ask 
for computing resources (such as server time and network storage) as you need 

them.• Broad network access
. You can access these services with a variety of technolo-
gies, such as mobile phones, laptops, desktops, and mainframe computers.• Resource pooling
. The cloud provider can put together a large number of mul-
tiple and varied resources to provide your requested services. This “multitenant 

model” permits a single resource (or collection of resources) to be accessed by 
multiple customers, and a particular resource (such as storage, processing or 

memory) can be assigned and reassigned dynamically, according to the custom-

ers’ demands. This reconfiguration and reallocation are invisible to an individ-

ual customer; from the customer’s point of view, services are provided without 

knowledge of the underlying location or locations.
