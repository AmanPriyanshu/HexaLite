408 Chapter 6  
NetworksAs shown in Figure 6-22, in the teardrop attack, the attacker sends a series of data-
grams that cannot fit together properly. One datagram might say it is position 0 for 

length 60 bytes, another position 30 for 90 bytes, and another position 41 for 173 bytes. 
These three pieces overlap, so they cannot be reassembled properly. In an extreme case, 

the operating system locks up with these partial data units it cannot reassemble, thus 
leading to denial of service.Another cause of denial of service is based in network routing: If routing tables 
no longer point at a site, that site is effectively unreachable. We describe routing 

attacks next.
Denial of Service by Addressing Failures
As we described earlier, another way the attacker can deny service is by preventing 

access, physically or logically. In this section we consider ways to prevent data from 

getting to the victim. You can see that anyone who can sever, interrupt, or overload a 

system’s capacity can deny service. The physical threats are rather obvious and are 

described later in this chapter. We consider instead several electronic attacks that can 

cause a denial of service. In this section we look at ways service can be denied inten-

tionally or accidentally.
Misrouting is an attack that achieves two goals. Suppose your neighbor’s home 
address is 217 Main Street, but you take down the numbers on her house and put 217 

above your own house instead. Then, all of your neighbor’s mail would be delivered 

to your house and your neighbor would get none. You would be ideally positioned to
