is a registered Tory.
Direct Inference
Inference
 is a way to infer or derive sensitive data from nonsensitive data. The infer-
ence problem is a subtle vulnerability in database security.
The database in Table 7-7 illustrates the inference problem; this database has the same 
form as the one introduced in Table 7-6, but we have added more data to make some 

points related to multiple data items. Recall that AID is the amount of financial aid a stu-

dent is receiving. FINES is the amount of parking fines still owed. DRUGS is the result 

of a drug-use survey: 0 means never used and 3 means frequent user. Obviously this 

information should be kept confidential. We assume that AID, FINES, and DRUGS are 

sensitive fields, although only when the values are related to a specific individual. In this 

section, we look at ways to determine sensitive data values from the database.
Direct Attack In a direct attack
, a user tries to determine values of sensitive fields by seeking them 
directly with queries that yield few records. The most successful technique is to form a 

query so specific that it matches exactly one data item.
In Table 7-7, a sensitive query might be
