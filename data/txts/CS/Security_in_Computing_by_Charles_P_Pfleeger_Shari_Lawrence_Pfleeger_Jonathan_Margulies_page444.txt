410 Chapter 6  
Networksman-in-the-middle explanation for routers is a bit complicated, so we present a sim-
plified version that highlights the middle role; for a more complete description of this 

phenomenon, consult Hepner et al. [HEP09].Each router sends a message to other routers, listing addresses to which it has a path; the other routers then add their paths and forward the extended list to the other routers 

as well. In this way, all routers learn of the connections of other routers. In Figure 6-25, 

four routers control four subnets: A controls the 10.0.0.0 subnet; B, the 20.0.0.0, and 

so forth. A is adjacent to B, B is adjacent to C, and T is another router not adjacent to 

any of the other three. A advertises to its neighbors that it is a distance of 1 from any 

machine in the 10.0.0.0 subnet.Because B has just learned that router A is only distance 1 from the 10.0.0.0 sub-
net, B advertises to its neighbors A and C that it is distance 1 from its own subnet and
