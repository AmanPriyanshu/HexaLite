193  to an executable file or traveling within data files. The travel itself occurs during execu-
tion of an already infected program. Since a virus can execute any instructions a pro-

gram can, virus travel is not confined to any single medium or execution pattern. For 

example, a virus can arrive on a diskette or from a network connection, travel during 

its host’s execution to a hard disk boot sector, reemerge next time the host computer is 

booted, and remain in memory to infect other diskettes as they are accessed.
Polymorphic Viruses 
The virus signature may be the most reliable way for a virus scanner to identify a 

virus. If a particular virus always begins with the string 0x47F0F00E08 and has string 

0x00113FFF located at word 12, other programs or data files are not likely to have these 

exact characteristics. For longer signatures, the probability of a correct match increases.
If the virus scanner will always look for those strings, then the clever virus writer can 
cause something other than those strings to be in those positions. Certain instructions 
cause no effect, such as adding 0 to a number, comparing a number to itself, or jump-

ing to the next instruction. These instructions, sometimes called 
no-ops (for “no opera-tion”), can be sprinkled into a piece of code to distort any pattern. For example, the 

virus could have two alternative but equivalent beginning words; after being installed, 

the virus will choose one of the two words for its initial word. Then, a virus scanner

Virus Effects and What They Cause
Virus EffectHow It Is Caused
Attach to executable program• Modify file directory
• Write to executable program file
Attach to data or control file• Modify directory
• Rewrite data

• Append to data

• Append data to self
Remain in memory• Intercept interrupt by modifying interrupt handler address table
• Load self in nontransient memory area
Infect disks• Intercept interrupt
• Intercept operating system call (to format disk, for example)

• Modify system file

• Modify ordinary executable program
Conceal self• Intercept system calls that would reveal self and falsify result
• Classify self as “hidden” file
Spread infection• Infect boot sector
• Infect system program

• Infect ordinary program

• Infect data ordinary program reads to control its execution
Prevent deactivation• Activate before deactivating program and block deactivation
• Store copy to reinfect after deactivation
