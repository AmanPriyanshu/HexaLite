472 Chapter 6  
Networks• Firewalls are targets for penetrators. While a firewall is designed to withstand 
attack, it is not impenetrable. Designers intentionally keep a firewall small and 

simple so that even if a penetrator breaks it, the firewall does not have further 

tools, such as compilers, linkers, loaders, and the like, to continue an attack.
• Firewalls exercise only minor control over the content admitted to the inside, 
meaning that inaccurate data or malicious code must be controlled by other 

means inside the perimeter.
Firewalls are important tools in protecting an environment connected to a network. 
However, the environment must be viewed as a whole, all possible exposures must be 

considered, and the firewall must fit into a larger, comprehensive security strategy. Fire-

walls alone cannot secure an environment.
Network Address Translation (NAT)
Firewalls protect internal hosts against unacceptable inbound or outbound data flows. 

However, as shown earlier in this chapter, sometimes an outsider can gain valuable 

information just by learning the architecture, connectivity, or even size of the internal 

network. When an internal host presents its IP address to an outsider (necessary if the 

outsider is expected to reply), the outsider can infer some of the network structure from 

the pattern of addresses. Furthermore, once released, this address will forever be known 

and exploitable by outsiders. Conveniently, a firewall can also prevent this information 

from escaping. Every packet between two hosts contains the source host’s address and port and 
the destination host’s address and port. Port 80 is the number conventionally used for 

HTTP (web page) access. As shown in Figure 6-63, internal host 192.168.1.35 port 

80 is sending a packet to external host 65.216.161.24 port 80. Using a process called 

network address translation (NAT)
, the source firewall converts source address 
192.168.1.35:80 in the packet to the firewall’s own address, 173.203.129.90. The fire-

wall also makes an entry in a trans-

lation table showing the destination 

address, the source port, and the 

original source address, to be able 

to forward any replies to the origi-

nal source address. As you might 

expect, the firewall converts the 

address back on any return packets.
The only complication to this scheme occurs if two internal hosts both contact the 
same destination address over the same port, which might be expected if two internal 

hosts independently wanted to access the web page at www.google.com, for example. 

In this case, the firewall would rewrite the source port number of one requesting host 

to a random different number so that the firewall could properly retranslate the return. 

Internal host 192.168.1.35 might become 173.203.129.90 port 4236, and 192.168.1.57 

might become 173.203.129.90 port 4966.Network address translation conceals 

real internal addresses; outsiders who 

do not know real addresses cannot 

access them directly.
