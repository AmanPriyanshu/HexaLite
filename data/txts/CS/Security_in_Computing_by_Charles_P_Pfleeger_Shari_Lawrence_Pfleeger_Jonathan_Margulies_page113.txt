etc.This representation may be more efficient than the access control matrix because there is 
no triple for any empty cell of the matrix (such as 
USER T, Bibliog, 
). Even though 
the triples can be sorted by subject or object as needed, searching a large number of these 

triples is inefficient enough that this implementation is seldom used.
