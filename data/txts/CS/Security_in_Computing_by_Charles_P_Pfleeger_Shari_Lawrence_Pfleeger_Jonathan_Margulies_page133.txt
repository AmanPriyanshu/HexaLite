 Section 2.3  Cryptography 
99  Strength of the Algorithm
The characteristics and apparent strength of DES and AES are compared in Table 2-12. 
Remember, of course, that these strength figures apply only if the implementation and 

use are robust; a strong algorithm loses strength if used with a weakness that lets outsid-

ers determine key properties of the encrypted data.
Moreover, the number of cycles can be extended in a natural way. With DES the 
algorithm was defined for precisely 16 cycles; to extend that number would require 

substantial redefinition of the algorithm. The internal structure of AES has no a priori 

limitation on the number of cycles. If a cryptanalyst ever concluded that 10 or 12 or 

14 rounds were too low, the only change needed to improve the algorithm would be to 

change the limit on a repeat loop.A mark of confidence is that the U.S. government has approved AES for protecting 
Secret and Top Secret classified documents. This is the first time the United States has 

ever approved the use of a commercial algorithm derived outside the government (and 

furthermore, outside the United States) to encrypt classified data.
