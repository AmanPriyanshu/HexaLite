IntroductionThe C-I-A triad can be viewed from a different perspective: the nature of the harm 
caused to assets. Harm can also be characterized by four acts: interception
, interrup-tion, modification
, and fabrication. These four acts are depicted in Figure 1-5. From 
this point of view, confidentiality can suffer if someone intercepts data, availability is 

lost if someone or something interrupts a flow of data or access to a computer, and 

integrity can fail if someone or something modifies data or fabricates false data. Think-

ing of these four kinds of acts can help you determine what threats might exist against 

the computers you are trying to protect.To analyze harm, we next refine the C-I-A triad, looking more closely at each of its 
elements.ConfidentialitySome things obviously need confidentiality protection. For example, students’ grades, 

financial transactions, medical records, and tax returns are sensitive. A proud student 

may run out of a classroom screaming “I got an A!” but the student should be the one 

to choose whether to reveal that grade to others. Other things, such as diplomatic and 

military secrets, companies’ marketing and product development plans, and educators’ 

tests, also must be carefully controlled. Sometimes, however, it is not so obvious that 

something is sensitive. For example, a military food order may seem like innocuous 

information, but a sudden increase in the order could be a sign of incipient engagement 

in conflict. Purchases of food, hourly changes in location, and access to books are not ModificationFabrication
