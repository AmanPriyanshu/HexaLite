17  SIDEBAR 1-1 An Attacker’s Psychological Profile?
Temple Grandin, a professor of animal science at Colorado State Univer-
sity and a sufferer from a mental disorder called Asperger syndrome (AS), 

thinks that Kevin Mitnick and several other widely described hackers show 
classic symptoms of Asperger syndrome. Although quick to point out that 

no research has established a link between AS and hacking, Grandin notes 

similar behavior traits among Mitnick, herself, and other AS sufferers. An 

article in 
USA Today 
(29 March 2001) lists the following AS traits:
• poor social skills, often associated with being loners during child-
hood; the classic “computer nerd”
• fidgeting, restlessness, inability to make eye contact, lack of response 
to cues in social interaction, such as facial expressions or body 

language• exceptional ability to remember long strings of numbers

• ability to focus on a technical problem intensely and for a long time, 
although easily distracted on other problems and unable to manage 

several tasks at once• deep honesty and respect for laws
