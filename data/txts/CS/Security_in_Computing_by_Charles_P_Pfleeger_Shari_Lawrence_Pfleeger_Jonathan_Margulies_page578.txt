DatabasesBig data raises security issues because of the amount of data being considered: Pro-tecting tens or hundreds of data items generally involves less risk and difficulty than 

billions or trillions. However, many of the protection issues are the same as in other 

domains: Securing data, protecting privacy, and ensuring integrity are concerns for 

single-user computers, multiuser computing systems, networks, cloud providers, and 

distributed applications, as well as big data processors.
In this section we list the security issues in big data, many times just pointing out that 
the issue is an instance of a more general security problem that appears elsewhere in 

this book. And because big data is an emerging field, we list problems and not solutions. 

From the examples of authorization, access control, and the like shown elsewhere in 

this book, you can propose tools and techniques applicable to these problems.PrivacyOne can argue that big data is unrelated to privacy: Data processors do not collect data 
but only sift through existing data. So, for example, big data users are not responsible 

for the fact that a store tracks customers’ purchases through customer loyalty cards or 

that the store then sells the tracking data to people interested in learning trends. On the 
other hand, big data’s collecting and correlating capabilities have made such use pos-

sible and even lucrative. Regardless, privacy issues arise. We study privacy in general
