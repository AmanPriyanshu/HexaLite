T3MFIGURE 6-37 Link EncryptionLink encryption is especially appropriate when the transmission line is the point of greatest vulnerability. If all hosts on a network are reasonably secure but the commu-

nications medium is shared with other users or is not secure, link encryption is an easy 
control to use. Link encryption is also desirable when all communication on a single 
line should be protected, for example, if the link is between two offices of one company, 

where all internal communications would be protected.
End-to-End Encryption As its name implies, end-to-end encryption provides security from one end of a trans-
mission to the other. The encryption can be applied between the user and the host by a 

hardware device. Alternatively, the encryption can be done by software running on the 

host computer. In either case, the encryption is performed at the highest levels, usually 

by an application at OSI level 7, but sometimes 5 or 6. A model of end-to-end encryp-

tion is shown in Figure 6-38.
