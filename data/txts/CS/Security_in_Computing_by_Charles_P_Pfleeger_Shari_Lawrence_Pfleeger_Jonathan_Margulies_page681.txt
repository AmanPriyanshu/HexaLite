64710Management and IncidentsIn this chapter we introduce concepts of managing security. Many readers of this 
book are, or will be, practitioners or technologists, people who design, implement, 

and use security. Devices, algorithms, architectures, protocols, and mechanisms are 
important for those readers.Some technologists think security involves just designing a stronger (faster, better, 
bigger) appliance or selecting the best cryptographic algorithm. That these are impor-

tant considerations is true. But what if you build something that nobody adopts? Per-

haps the user interface is inscrutable. Or people cannot figure out how to integrate your 

product into any existing system. Maybe it doesn’t really address the underlying secu-

rity problem. Perhaps it is too restrictive, preventing users from getting real work done. 

And maybe it is or seems too expensive. Technology—even the best product—has to be 

used and usable.In this chapter we consider two important topics: how security is managed and how 
it is used. These topics relate to human behavior, and also the business side of comput-

ing. We also address the physical side of security threats: natural disasters and those 

caused by humans.10.1 SECURITY PLANNING
Years ago, when most computing was done on mainframe computers, data process-

ing centers were responsible for protection. Responsibility for security rested neither 
 with the programmers nor the users but instead with the computing center staff itself. 

These centers developed expertise in security, and they implemented many protection
