Toolbox: Authentication, Access Control, and Cryptography
This action opens up the possibility that one subject, S, may have two distinct sets of 
access rights to F, one under the name Q and one under the name F. In this way, allowing 

pseudonyms can lead to multiple permissions that are not necessarily consistent. Thus, 

the directory approach is probably too simple for most object protection situations.Access Control Matrix
We can think of the directory as a listing of objects accessible by a single subject, and 
the access list as a table identifying subjects that can access a single object. The data in 

these two representations are equivalent, the distinction being the ease of use in given 

situations.As an alternative, we can use an 
access control matrix
, shown in Figure 2-11, a 
table in which each row represents a subject, each column represents an object, and 

each entry is the set of access rights for that subject to that object. A more detailed example representation of an access control matrix is shown in 
Table 2-8. Access rights shown in that table are O, own; R, read; W, write; and X, execute. 
In general, the access control matrix is sparse (meaning that most cells are empty): Most 
subjects do not have access rights to most objects. The access matrix can be represented 

as a list of triples, each having the form 
subject, object, rights, as shown in Table 2-9.
