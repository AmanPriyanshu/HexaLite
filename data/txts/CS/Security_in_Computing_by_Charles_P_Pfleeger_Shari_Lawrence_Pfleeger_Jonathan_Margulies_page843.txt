 Section 12.6  Quantum Cryptography 
809  Suppose the sender, Sam, generates a series of photons, remembering their orienta-
tion. Sam and his receiver, Ruth, call 
 or
 0 and 
 or  1. Such a series is shown 
in Figure 12-9.FIGURE 12-9 Transmission of Photons
Now, Ruth uses either of her polarizing filters, 
 and 
 at random, recording the 
result. Remember that a 
 filter will accurately distinguish between a 
 and 
 photon, but sometimes also declare a
 or 
 as a 
. So Ruth does not know if the results she 
measures are what Sam sent. Ruthâ€™s choice of filters, and the results she obtained, are 

shown in Figure 12-10.

FilterSome of those results are correct and some are incorrect, depending on the filter Ruth 
chose. Now Ruth sends to Sam the kind of filter she used, as shown in Figure 12-11.
