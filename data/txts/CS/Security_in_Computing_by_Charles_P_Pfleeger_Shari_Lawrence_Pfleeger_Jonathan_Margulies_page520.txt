NetworksGoals for Intrusion Detection SystemsThe two styles of intrusion detection—pattern matching and heuristic—represent differ-
ent approaches, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. Actual IDS products 

often blend the two approaches.
Ideally, an IDS should be fast, simple, and accurate, while at the same time being 
complete. It should detect all attacks with negligible performance penalty. An IDS could 

use some—or all—of the following design approaches:
• Filter on packet headers.
• Filter on packet content.

• Maintain connection state.

• Use complex, multipacket signatures.
announced its website was under a serious denial-of-service attack, even before the first release of diplomatic messages, but WikiLeaks continued to 

release the messages.
Unknown people, presumably angered by WikiLeaks’ breaching 
security in releasing these cables, apparently launched a denial-of-service 

attack against WikiLeaks. The severity of the attack was great enough that 

on 2 December WikiLeaks’ hosting provider, Amazon Web Services, a  

division of online bookseller Amazon.com, canceled its contract with 

WikiLeaks, forcing the site to find a new provider. Next, unknown people 

launched a denial-of-service attack against the DNS provider serving 

WikiLeaks, EveryDNS. WikiLeaks switched to a Swiss hosting provider, 

using a network architecture supported by 14 different DNS providers and 

over 350 mirror sites [BRA10]. Thus, the anti-WikiLeaks forces and their 

denial-of-service attack caused WikiLeaks to move content and to arrange 
hosting contracts abruptly.
Meanwhile, the anti- anti-WikiLeaks forces took action. A leaderless 
group, named Anonymous, on 8 December 2010 launched a series of 

denial-of-service attacks of their own, called Operation Payback. The tar-

gets were MasterCard, which had been accepting donations to transfer to 

WikiLeaks but had stopped that practice; Amazon, the web hosting com-

pany that canceled service for WikiLeaks; PayPal, which had also stopped 
accepting payments for WikiLeaks; and other smaller targets. Anonymous 
involved a group of about 1,500 activist hackers who were organizing in 

online forums and chats. The attack disabled MasterCard’s online services 

for about six hours.John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic Freedom Foundation 
(EFF) and Fellow at Harvard University’s Berkman Center for Internet and 

Society, tweeted: “The first serious infowar is now engaged. The field of 

battle is WikiLeaks. You are the troops.”
