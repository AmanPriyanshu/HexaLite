 Section 13.2  Economics 
829  Classification of Attack Types
Understandably, the surveys measure different things. One would hope to be able to 

extract similar data items from several surveys, but unfortunately that is not often the case.
For example, from 2003 to 2004, the Australian Computer Crime and Security 
Survey reported a decrease in attacks of all types, but during the same time period, a 

Deloitte survey found the rate of breaches to have been the same for several years. The 

variation may derive from the differences in the populations surveyed: different coun-

tries, sectors, and degrees of sophistication about security matters. 
Types of Respondents
Most of these surveys are convenience surveys, meaning that the respondents are self-

selected and do not form a representative sample of a larger population. For conve-

nience surveys, it is usually difficult or impossible to determine which population the 

results represent, making it difficult to generalize the findings. 
For example, how can we tell if survey respondents represent the more general popu-
lation of security practitioners or users? Similarly, if, in a given survey, 500 respon-

dents reported having experienced attacks, what does that tell us? If the 500 respondents 
emails, followed by virus or worm infection and trojan or rootkit mal-
ware. . . . [R]espondents viewed cyber security incidents to be tar-

geted at their organisation, rather than random or indiscriminate.”• The Deloitte Technology, Media and Telecommunications Global Secu-

Report_04_March_2013.pdf. Example finding: In 2012, regulatory 

compliance was the primary driver for improving cyber security. But 

in 2013, regulatory compliance was not even in the top ten: secu-

rity strategy and roadmap topped the list. This change suggests that 

“information security is fundamental to their business and not just a 

compliance issue anymore.”
• Ernst and Young’s Global Information Security Survey
: This survey 
involves data from 1900 Ernst and Young client organizations world-

wide, supplemented by in-depth interviews with executives plus sec-
ondary research to “provide depth and context” for its findings. It is 

available at http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY_-_2013_

Global_Information_Security_Survey/$FILE/EY-GISS-Under-cyber-

attack.pdf. Example finding: In the 2012 report, none of the chief 

security officers reported to the company’s chief executive officer. But 

in the 2013 report, ten percent reported to the CEO. This change sug-

gests that businesses now recognize that security is essential to the 

company’s bottom line. 
These surveys provide some insight into how organizations prepare 
for security situations.
