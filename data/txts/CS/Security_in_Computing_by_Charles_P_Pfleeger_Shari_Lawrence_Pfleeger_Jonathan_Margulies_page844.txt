Correct Results FilterSam tells Ruth which filters were the correct ones she used, as shown in Fig-
ure 12-12, from which Ruth can determine which of the results obtained were correct, 
as shown in Figure 12-13. In this example, Ruth happened to choose the right filter six 

times out of ten, slightly higher than expected, and so six of the ten photons transmitted 

were received correctly. Remembering that 
 or
 means 0 and 
 or  means 1, Ruth 
can convert the photons to bits, as shown in the figure. In general, only half the photons 

transmitted will be received correctly, and so only half the bandwidth of this communi-

cation channel carries meaningful data.Notice that Ruth can tell Sam which filters she used and Sam can tell Ruth which of 
those will yield correct results without revealing anything about the actual bits transmit-

ted. In this way, Sam and Ruth can talk 
about their transmission without an eavesdrop-
perâ€™s knowing what they actually share.
