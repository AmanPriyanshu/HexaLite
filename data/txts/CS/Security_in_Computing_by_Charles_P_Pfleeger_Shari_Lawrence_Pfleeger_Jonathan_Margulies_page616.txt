Cloud ComputingJust as you will want to specialize your VMs for security reasons, you will also 
want to specialize your networks. IaaS providers commonly offer customers the option 

of easily segregating systems into private network enclaves that are not addressable 

from the Internet. Use these private enclaves to segregate your systems by function (see 

Figure 8-8). For instance, put your FTP servers in one enclave and your web servers 

in another. Protect each enclave with firewall rules that limit traffic to what you know 

to be necessary. Doing all of this will limit every system’s exposure as much as pos-

sible and help prevent attacks from spreading across your systems. Of course, most of 

these systems will be servers that somehow have to be reachable from the Internet; for 

this purpose, use application proxy servers that relay traffic into the private enclaves. 

You will likely want to place the typical boundary protection devices we discuss in  

Chapter 6—firewalls, IDSs, IPSs, and their ilk—in VMs that sit between the Internet 

and the proxy servers.
Your VMs will have to run SSH or some sort of screen-sharing software so that you 
can administer them. Limit access to these services: They are prime targets of attackers. 

One way to accomplish this is to use network ACLs to limit SSH and screen-sharing 

traffic so that the connections must originate from your IP address space. You can also 

use log data to discover and investigate failed login attempts to those services. You 

should collect log data from all of your VMs, but do not store the log data on the same 

IaaS infrastructure as your VMs unless absolutely necessary. If the IaaS infrastructure
