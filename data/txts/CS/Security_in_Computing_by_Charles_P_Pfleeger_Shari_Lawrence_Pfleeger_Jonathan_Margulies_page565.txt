be yet more nonsensitive data that the user cannot infer.
The ideal combination of security and precision allows us to maintain perfect con-

next section. Sidebar 7-5 gives an example of using imprecise techniques to improve 

accuracy. In the next section, we consider ways in which sensitive data can be obtained 

from queries that appear harmless.FIGURE 7-4 Security versus Precision
