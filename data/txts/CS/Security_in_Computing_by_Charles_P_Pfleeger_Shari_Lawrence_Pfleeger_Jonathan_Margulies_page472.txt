NetworksSSH EncryptionSSH (secure shell) is a pair of protocols (versions 1 and 2) originally defined for Unix 
but now available under most operating systems. SSH provides an authenticated and 

encrypted path to the shell or operating system command interpreter. Both SSH ver-

sions replace Unix utilities such as Telnet, rlogin, and rsh for remote access. SSH pro-

tects against spoofing attacks and modification of data in communication.
The SSH protocol involves negotiation between local and remote sites for encryp-
tion algorithm (for example, DES or AES) and authentication (including public key and 

Kerberos).
In 2008, a team of British researchers [ALB09] devised an attack by which they 
could recover 32 bits of data from an SSH session in certain circumstances. Although 

exposure of 32 bits of data is significant, the British Centre for the Protection of the 

National Infrastructure rated the likelihood of successful attack as low because of the 

conditions necessary for a successful attack. Nevertheless, you should note that the pro-

tocol does have a known vulnerability.
SSL and TLS EncryptionThe Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
 protocol was originally designed by Netscape in 
the mid-1990s to protect communication between a web browser and server. It went 

through three versions: SSL 1.0 (private), SSL 2.0 (1995), and SSL 3.0 (1996). In 1999, 

the Internet Engineering Task Force upgraded SSL 3.0 and named the upgrade
