412 Chapter 6  
NetworksIn Figure 6-28 we complicated the scene a bit by adding more routers; for simplicity we do not show their subnetworks. These routers will all advertise their connectivity, 

from which they can determine the shortest path between any pair of points. Notice that 

A is rather isolated from T; its shortest path is B-N-P-Q-T.
Routers operate on implicit trust; what a router reports is believed to be true. Rout-
ers do, however, sometimes malfunction or their administrators enter inaccurate data, so 

routing tables can become corrupted from nonmalicious (and malicious) causes. In our 
example, if router A advertised it was distance 1 from the 90.0.0.0 subnetwork, most traf-

fic to that subnetwork would be routed to A, because that distance would beat any path 

except T itself. If A received that traffic, it could easily intercept and modify any traffic 

to that network, so a rogue router in 

a network could instigate a man-in-

the-middle attack in this way.
Router Takes Over a Network
At the 2008 Defcon conference, most attendees were unaware that two researchers had 
rerouted the conferenceâ€™s wireless network through their equipment. The research-

ers, Pilosov and Kapela [PIL08] described and demonstrated their attack. Although 

the attack is more detailed than we want to present here, it extends the approach just 

described. Other papers (such as [HEP09, KUH07, and BEL89]) have discussed similar 

vulnerabilities.Routers communicate available paths by the BGP (Border Gateway) protocol, which 
is complex, so attacks against it are sophisticated but certainly feasible. Details such as 

timing and sequence numbers must be captured and used correctly in order for a BGP 
update to be recognized and accepted by the rest of the network. Furthermore, attacks on
