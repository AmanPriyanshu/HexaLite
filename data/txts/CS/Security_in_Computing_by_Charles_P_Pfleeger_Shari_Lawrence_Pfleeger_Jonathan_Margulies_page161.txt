stored for download.
This description of digital signatures concludes our section on tools from cryptogra-phy. We summarize the tools in Table 2-15. In this section we have introduced important 

pieces we call upon later in this book.Our point in this chapter is not to train a new corps of cryptographers or cryptolo-
gists; to do that would require far more material than this book can contain. Rather, 

we want you to know and understand the basic concepts of cryptography so in later 

chapters you can appreciate the difficulty, strengths, and weaknesses of, for example, 

securing a wireless network signal or establishing a protected communication between 

a browser user and a website.
In the next chapter we put the three tools of this chapter to use in dealing with secu-
rity problems in programs and programming.2.4 EXERCISES
1. Describe each of the following four kinds of access control mechanisms in terms of (a) ease 
of determining authorized access during execution, (b) ease of adding access for a new sub-

ject, (c) ease of deleting access by a subject, and (d) ease of creating a new object to which 

all subjects by default have access.
â€¢ per-subject access control list (that is, one list for each subject tells all the objects to 

which that subject has access)TABLE 2-15

Public key (asymmetric) 
encryptionExchanging (symmetric) encryption keys
Signing data to show authenticity and proof of origin
Error detection codes
Detect changes in dataHash codes and functions (forms of error detection codes)
Detect changes in dataCryptographic hash functionsDetect changes in data, using a function that only the data owner 
can compute (so an outsider cannot change both data and the hash 
code result to conceal the fact of the change)
Error correction codes
Detect and repair errors in dataDigital signatures
Attest to the authenticity of dataDigital certificates
Allow parties to exchange cryptographic keys with confidence of 
the identities of both parties
