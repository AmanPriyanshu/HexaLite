xxii Foreword
This book addresses the broad sweep of issues above: the nature of the threat 
 and system vulnerabilities (Chapter 1); cryptography (Chapters 2 and 12); software 

vulnerabilities (Chapter 3); the Common Criteria (Chapter 5); the World Wide Web 

and Internet (Chapters 4 and 6); managing risk (Chapter 10); and legal, ethical and 

privacy issues (Chapter 11). The book also describes security controls that are currently 

available such as encryption protocols, software development practices, firewalls, and 

intrusion-detection systems. Overall, this book provides a broad and sound foundation 

for the information-system specialist who is charged with planning and/or organizing 

and/or managing and/or implementing a comprehensive information-system security 

program.Yet to be solved are many technical aspects of information security—R&D for hard-
ware, software, systems, and architecture; and the corresponding products. Notwith-

standing, technology per se is not the long pole in the tent of progress. Organizational 

and management motivation and commitment to get the security job done is. Today, the 

collective information infrastructure of the country and of the world is slowly moving 

up the learning curve; every mischievous or malicious event helps to push it along. The 

terrorism-based events of recent times are helping to drive it. Is it far enough up the 

curve to have reached an appropriate balance between system safety and threat? Almost 

certainly, the answer is “no, not yet; there is a long way to go.” [10]
