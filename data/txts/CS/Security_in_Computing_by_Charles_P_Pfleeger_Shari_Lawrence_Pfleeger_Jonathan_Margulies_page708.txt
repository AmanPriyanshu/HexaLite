674 Chapter 10  
Management and IncidentsIn thinking about the contents of each matrix entry, we can ask the following 
questions.• What are the effects of unintentional errors? Consider typing the wrong com-
mand, entering the wrong data, using the wrong data item, discarding the wrong 
listing, and disposing of output insecurely. 
• What are the effects of willfully malicious insiders? Consider disgruntled 
employees, bribery, and curious browsers. 
• What are the effects of outsiders? Consider network access, remote access, 
hackers, people walking through the building, people snooping at coffee shops, 

and people sifting through the trash.• What are the effects of natural and physical disasters? Consider fires, storms, 
floods, power outages, and component failures. 
Table 10-3 is a version of the previous table with some of the entries filled in. It 
shows that certain general problems can affect the assets of a computing system. Plan-

ners at a given installation will determine what can happen to specific hardware, soft-

ware, data items, and other assets.
