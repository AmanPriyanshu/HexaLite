248 Chapter 4  
The Web—User Side
A defacement is common not only because of its visibility but also because of the 
ease with which one can be done. Web sites are designed so that their code is down-

loaded, enabling an attacker to obtain the full hypertext document and all programs 

directed to the client in the loading process. An attacker can even view programmers’ 

comments left in as they built or maintained the code. The download process essentially 

gives the attacker the blueprints to the web site.
Fake Web Site
A similar attack involves a fake web site. In Figure 4-7 we show a fake version of 
the web site of Barclays Bank (England) at http://www.gb-bclayuk.com/. The real 
 Barclays site is at http://group.barclays.com/Home. As you can see, the forger had some 

trouble with the top image, but if that were fixed, the remainder of the site would look 

convincing.
Web sites are easy to fake because the attacker can obtain copies of the images the 
real site uses to generate its web site. 

All the attacker has to do is change 

the values of links to redirect the 

unsuspecting victim to points of the 
attacker’s choosing.

a real site uses; fake sites can look 

convincing.
