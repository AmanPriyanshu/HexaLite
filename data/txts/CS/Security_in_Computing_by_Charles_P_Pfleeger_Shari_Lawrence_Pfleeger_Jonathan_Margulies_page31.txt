xxxiIt is increasingly difficult to acknowledge all the people who have influenced this 
book. Colleagues and friends have contributed their knowledge and insight, often 

without knowing their impact. By arguing a point or sharing explanations of con-
cepts, our associates have forced us to question or rethink what we know.
We thank our associates in at least two ways. First, we have tried to include ref-
erences to their written works. References in the text cite specific papers relating to 

particular thoughts or concepts, but the bibliography also includes broader works that 

have played a more subtle role in shaping our approach to security. So, to all the cited 

authors, many of whom are friends and colleagues, we happily acknowledge your posi-

tive influence on this book. 
Rather than name individuals, we thank the organizations in which we have inter-
acted with creative, stimulating, and challenging people from whom we learned a lot. 

These places include Trusted Information Systems, the Contel Technology Center, the 

Centre for Software Reliability of the City University of London, Arca Systems, Exodus 

Communications, The RAND Corporation, Sandia National Lab, Cable & Wireless, 

the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Institute for Information Infra-

structure Protection, Qmulos, and the Editorial Board of IEEE Security & Privacy.
 If 
you worked with us at any of these locations, chances are high that your imprint can 

be found in this book. And for all the side conversations, debates, arguments, and light 

moments, we are grateful.Acknowledgments
