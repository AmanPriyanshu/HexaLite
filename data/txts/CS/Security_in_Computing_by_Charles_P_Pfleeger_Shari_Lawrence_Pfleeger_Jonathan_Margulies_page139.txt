 Section 2.3  Cryptography 
105  The problem we want to solve is for Amy and Bill to be able to establish a secret 
(symmetric algorithm) encryption key that only they know. The simplest solution is for 

Amy to choose any symmetric key 
K, and send E(kPRIV-
A, K) to Bill. Bill takes Amy’s 
public key, removes the encryption, and obtains 
K. This analysis is flawed, however. How does the sender know the public key really 
belongs to the intended recipient? Consider, for example, the following scenario. Sup-

pose Amy and Bill do not have a convenient bulletin board. So, Amy just asks Bill for 

his key. Basically, the key exchange protocol, depicted in Figure 2-24, would work 

like this:
1. Amy says: Bill, please send me your public key.
2. Bill replies: Here, Amy; this is my public key.
3. Amy responds: Thanks. I have generated a symmetric key for us to use for 
this interchange. I am sending you the symmetric key encrypted under your 

public key.
In the subversion shown in Figure 2-25, we insert an attacker, Malvolio, into this 
communication.1. Amy says: Bill, please send me your public key.
 1a. 
Malvolio intercepts the message and fashions a new message to Bill, purport-
ing to come from Amy but with Malvolio’s return address, asking for Bill’s 

public key.
 2. 
Bill replies: Here, Amy; this is my public key. (Because of the return address in 
step 1a, this reply goes to Malvolio.)
 2a. 
Malvolio holds Bill’s public key and sends Malvolio’s own public key to Amy, 
alleging it is from Bill.
 3. 
Amy responds: Thanks. I have generated a symmetric key for us to use for 
this interchange. I am sending you the symmetric key encrypted under your 

public key.
