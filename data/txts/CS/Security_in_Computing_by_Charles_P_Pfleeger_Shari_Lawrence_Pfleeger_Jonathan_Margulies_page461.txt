 Section 6.5  Distributed Denial-of-Service 
427  Botnet Command and Control Update
Just like a conventional army, a network of bots requires a command hierarchy; the 
bots require officers to tell them when to attack, against whom, and with what weapon. 

The bot headquarters is called a command-and-control center
. The basic structure 
of such an army is shown in Figure 6-35. The mastermind wants to be isolated from 

the actual configuration, to reduce the likelihood of detection. Also, in case part of the 

army is isolated and taken down, the attacker wants redundancy to be able to regroup, 
In this instance, Villeneuve and his colleagues at the Toronto-based 
security firm SecDev worked with British ISP Coreix and others to take 

down three of Koobface’s main command-and-control servers in November 

2010. Villeneuve infiltrated one of those servers by monitoring its messag-

ing to four phone numbers in Moscow.
Even if this action does not completely disable Koobface, it certainly 
slows the operation. Furthermore, the analysis revealed other servers that 

experts can monitor to see where else Koobface’s handlers try to establish 

bases.AttackerAttackerMasterMasterMasterC&CC&CC&CBotBotBotBotBotBotVictimFIGURE 6-35 Botnet Command-and-Control Structure
