 Section 6.8  Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems 
479  As with pattern-matching, heu-ristic intrusion detection is limited 

by the amount of information the 

system has seen (to classify actions 
into the right category) and how well the current actions fit into one of these categories.
Rate of data flow does work for detecting flooding. When a particular target receives 
an abnormally high rate of traffic, that flow stands out for some reason. The reason may 

be legitimate, as when many customers visit a site in response to a television advertise-

ment, or it may be because of an attack.Stateful Protocol Analysis
As we noted, intrusion detection by means of pattern matching is difficult if the pat-
tern to be matched is long or variable. A SYN flood attack has a simple pattern (SYN, 

SYN-ACK, no corresponding ACK), but these are three separate steps spread over time; 

detecting the attack requires recognizing step one, later finding step two, and then wait-

ing a reasonable amount of time before concluding that step three is true. Think of an 

intrusion detection system as a state machine, with a state for each of these steps, as 
shown in Figure 6-65. The IDS needs to record which state it is in. Now multiply the 
Heuristic intrusion detection infers 
attacks by tracking suspicious activity.
