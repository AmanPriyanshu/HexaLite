797  our final result mod 143, we can reduce any term, such as 7

8  72 mod 143  392 mod 143  106.)This answer is correct since D(106)  10611 mod 143  7.Strength of the RSA Algorithm
The RSA algorithm derives strength from the fact that it is based on the problem of 
efficiently factoring numbers in a finite field, a long-standing open problem in number 

theory. The problem is, of course, solvable, using the brute-force technique of trying all 

possible factors, but in a large field, that is, for large values of 
n, the brute force tech-nique is infeasible. The trick that makes RSA encryption workable depends on a hidden 

technique for picking n. Mathematical Foundations of the RSA AlgorithmThe Euler totient function j(n) is the number of positive integers less than 
n that are 
relatively prime to 
n. If p is prime, thenj(p)  p − 1Furthermore, if n  p  q, where p and q are both prime, thenj(n)  j(p) * j(q)  (p − 1) * (q − 1)Euler and Fermat proved that
xj(n)  1 mod nfor any integer 
x if n and x are relatively prime.
Suppose we encrypt a plaintext message 
P by the RSA algorithm so that E(P)  Pe. We need to be sure we can recover the message. The value 
e is selected, so we can eas-ily find its inverse 
d. Because e and d are inverses mod 
j(n), e  d  1 mod 
j(n)or
 e  d    k  j(n)  1   ()for some integer 
k.Because of the Euler–Fermat result, assuming P and p are relatively prime,
 Pp − 1  1 mod 
pand, since (p−1) is a factor of 
j(n), Pkj(n)  1 mod 
pMultiplying by P produces Pkj(n)1  P mod pThe same argument holds for 
q, so Pkj(n)1  P mod q
