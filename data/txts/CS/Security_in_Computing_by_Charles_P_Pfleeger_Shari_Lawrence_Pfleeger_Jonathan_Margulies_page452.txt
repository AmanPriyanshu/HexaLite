NetworksDNS Cache PoisoningThe DNS cache poisoning attack is a way to subvert the addressing to cause a DNS 
server to redirect clients to a specified address. A conceptually simple DNS poisoning 

attack is to forge a message to a DNS registrar, requesting that a particular domain 

name be changed from one address to another. These requests occur normally when a 

website is moved from one hosting provider to another or when an organization changes 

its address structure. However, a malicious attacker can use a DNS change request to 

redirect traffic intended for a particular domain name. Because of strong authentication 

requirements, registrars seldom succumb to such a forgery.
A more likely attack is to use the DNS protocol messages by which all Internet 
name servers coordinate their address translations. Dan Kaminsky [KAM08] expanded 

on some previously known methods to poison the DNS cache. The DNS protocol is 

complex, but you do not need to understand the details in order to appreciate this attack. 
A client requiring the address corresponding to a domain name sends a query to its local DNS name server. If that server does not have the answer, it forwards the query 

to a root name server; the query is forwarded to more-specific name servers until one 

replies authoritatively with the address. That address is propagated through the chain of 

servers involved in resolving the query and eventually back to the client. The servers 

along the way cache the response so that they can respond directly to future queries for 

the same address.Receiver
