DatabasesAdvantages of Using DatabasesThe logical idea behind a database is this: A database is a single collection of data, 
stored and maintained at one central location, to which many people have access as 

needed. However, the actual implementation may involve some other physical storage 

arrangement or access. The essence of a good database is that the users are unaware of 

the physical arrangements; the unified logical arrangement is all they see. As a result, a 

database offers many advantages over a simple file system:
• shared access, 
so that many users can use one common, centralized set of data
• controlled access, 
so that only authorized users are allowed to view or to modify 
data values
• minimal redundancy, 
so that individual users do not have to collect and maintain 
their own sets of data
• data consistency, 
so that a change to a data value affects all users of the 
data value
• data integrity, 
so that data values are protected against accidental or malicious 
undesirable changesYou should notice many familiar security concepts in this list. Although security 
is only one of several motivations 

for using a database, some users 

appreciate having a degree of secure 

access.A DBMS is designed to provide 
these advantages efficiently. However, as often happens, the objectives can conflict with 

each other. In particular, as we shall see, security interests can conflict with perfor-

mance. This clash is not surprising, because measures taken to enforce security often
