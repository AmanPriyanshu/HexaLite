NetworksBecause the encryption precedes all the routing and transmission processing of 
the layer, the message is transmitted in encrypted form throughout the network. Of 

course, only the data portion of the message is protected, but often the headers are not 

as sensitive as the data. The encryption addresses potential flaws in lower layers in 

the transfer model. If a lower layer should fail to preserve security and reveal data it 

has received, the dataâ€™s confidenti-

ality is not endangered. Figure 6-39 
shows a typical message with end-

to-end encryption, again with the 

encrypted field shaded.

T3MWhen end-to-end encryption is used, messages sent through several hosts are pro-
tected. The data content of the message is still encrypted, as shown in Figure 6-40, and 

the message is encrypted (protected against disclosure) while in transit. Therefore, even 

though a message must pass through potentially insecure nodes (such as C through F) on 

the path between A and B, the message is protected against disclosure while in transit.
