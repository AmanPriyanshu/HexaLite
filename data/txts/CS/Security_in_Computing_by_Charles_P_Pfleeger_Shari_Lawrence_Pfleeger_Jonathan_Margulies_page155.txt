of names and signatures.Certificates: Trustable Identities and Public Keys
You may have concluded that this process works, but it is far too cumbersome to apply 

in real life; perhaps you have surmised that we are building a system for computers. 

This protocol is represented more easily electronically than on paper. With paper, peo-

ple must guard against forgeries, to prevent part of one chain from being replaced and 

to ensure that the public key at the bottom is bound to the chain. The whole thing can 

be done electronically with digital signatures and hash functions. Kohnfelder [KOH78] 

seems to be the originator of the concept of using an electronic certificate with a chain 

of authenticators; Merkleâ€™s paper [MER80] expands the concept.
