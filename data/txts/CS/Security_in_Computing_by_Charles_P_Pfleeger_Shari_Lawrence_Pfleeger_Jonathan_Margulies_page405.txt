 Section 6.2  Threats to Network Communications 
371  Another thing an attacker can learn is connectivity. Figure 6-12 concerns a single 
host. In Figure 6-13 we have expanded the search to an entire subnetwork (again, with 

changed name and address). As you can see, the network consists of a router, three com-

puters, and one unidentified device. 
The information from Figure 6-14 gives another important clue: Because the latency 
time (the time between when a packet is sent to the device and the device responds) for 

all devices is similar, they are probably on the same network segment. Thus, you could 

sketch a connectivity diagram of the network (as shown in Figure 6-14).
 Nmap has many options; an outsider can fingerprint owners and users, identify 
common services running on uncommon ports, map the connectivity (routes between) 

machines, or deduce the real kind of unknown device. Notice that with only a couple of 

commands the attacker in the two examples shown learns
• how many hosts there are
• what their IP addresses are

address: 192.168.1.1 (ipv4)
