 Section 6.7  Firewalls 
451  Architecture (a) affords some advantages over architecture (b). First, host A becomes 
a single point of failure: If gateway A is not available for any reason, it cannot pass traf-

fic to or from B–E, meaning they are effectively disconnected from the network. Fur-

thermore, the gateway device A becomes a potential bottleneck, so devices B through 

E share access through A; if A is slow or if one of B–E consumes a large amount of 

network bandwidth, the other machines’ performance suffers.
We can even expand the notion of protected subnets to two or more subnets, as shown 
in Figure 6-51. The three subnets 

could be for separate departments or 
user groups, or they could be allo-

cated geographically. Of course, the 

more subnets gateway A supports, 

the more risk if device A fails.
Reconfiguring the architecture of a network limits or complicates movement, but it 
does not address the central security goal of controlled access. To accomplish that goal 

we depend on a device called a firewall, which we describe next.
6.7 FIREWALLS
Firewalls in buildings, as their name implies, are walls intended to inhibit the spread 

of fire from one part of a building to another, for example, between one apartment and 

the next. Firewalls are built of materials that withstand fires of a particular intensity or
