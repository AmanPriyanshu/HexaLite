Management and Incidentsaccess control software is high ($25,000), its cost is easily justified when compared to 
its value, as shown in Table 10-7. Because the entire cost of the package is charged in 

the first year, even greater benefits are expected for subsequent years.
Another company uses a common carrier to link to a network for certain computing 
applications. The company has identified the risks of unauthorized access to data and 

computing facilities through the network. The company can eliminate these risks by 

replacing remote network access with the requirement to access the system only from a 

machine operated on the company premises. The machine is not already owned; a new 

one would have to be acquired. The economics of this example are not promising, as 

shown in Table 10-8.
