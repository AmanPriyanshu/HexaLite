 Exercises 231  14. Several proposals have been made for a processor that could decrypt encrypted data and 
machine instructions and then execute the instructions on the data. The processor would then 

encrypt the results. How would such a processor be useful? What are the design requirements 

for such a processor?15. Explain in what circumstances penetrate-and-patch is a useful program maintenance strategy.
16. Describe a programming situation in which least privilege is a good strategy to improve 
security.
17. Explain why genetic diversity is a good principle for secure development. Cite an example of 
lack of diversity that has had a negative impact on security.
18. Describe how security testing differs from ordinary functionality testing. What are the crite-
ria for passing a security test that differ from functional criteria? 
 19. 
(a)  You receive an email message that purports to come from your bank. It asks you to click 
a link for some reasonable-sounding administrative purpose. How can you verify that the 

message actually did come from your bank?(b) Now play the role of an attacker. How could you intercept the message described in part 
(a) and convert it to your purposes while still making both the bank and the customer 

think the message is authentic and trustworthy?
 20. 
Open design would seem to favor the attacker, because it certainly opens the implementation 
and perhaps also the design for the attacker to study. Justify that open design overrides this 

seeming advantage and actually leads to solid security.
