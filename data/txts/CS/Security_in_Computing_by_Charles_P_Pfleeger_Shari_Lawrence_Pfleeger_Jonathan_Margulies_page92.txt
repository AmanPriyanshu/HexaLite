Toolbox: Authentication, Access Control, and Cryptography
• The speed at which a recognition must be done limits accuracy. We might ide-
ally like to take several readings and merge the results or evaluate the closest fit. 

But authentication is done to allow a user to do something: Authentication is not 

the end goal but a gate keeping the user from the goal. The user understandably 

wants to get past the gate and becomes frustrated and irritated if authentication 

takes too long.
• Although we like to think of biometrics as unique parts of an individual, 
forger-
ies are possible. Some examples of forgeries are described in Sidebar 2-7.
Biometrics depend on a physical characteristic that can vary from one day to the next 
or as people age. Consider your hands, for example: On some days, the temperature, 

your activity level, or other factors may cause your hands to swell, thus distorting your 

hands’ physical characteristics. But an authentication should not fail just because the 

day is hot. Biometric recognition also depends on how the sample is taken. For hand 

geometry, for example, you place your hand on a template, but measurements will vary 

slightly depending on exactly how you position your hand. 
Authentication with biometrics uses a pattern or template, much like a baseline, 
that represents measurement of the characteristic. When you use a biometric for

SIDEBAR 2-6 ContinuedFor a matching or screening system, as for any test, system admin-
istrators must determine what levels of sensitivity and specificity are 

acceptable. The levels depend on the intention of the test, the setting, the 
prevalence of the target criterion, alternative methods for accomplishing 

the same goal, and the costs and benefits of testing.
