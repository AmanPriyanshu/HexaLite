 Section 3.1  Unintentional (Nonmalicious) Programming Oversights 
151  some termination code cleans up the stack, reloads registers, and returns. Just below 
the program counter, StackGuard inserts a canary value to signal modification; if the 

attacker rewrites the program counter and the added value, StackGuard augments the 

termination code to detect the modified added value and signal an error before return-

ing. Thus, each canary value serves as a protective insert to protect the program counter. 

These protective inserts are shown in Figure 3-11. The idea of surrounding the return 

address with a tamper-detecting value is sound, as long as only the defender can gener-

ate and verify that value.
Alas, the attackâ€“countermeasure tennis match was played here, as we have seen in 
other situations such as password guessing: The attacker serves, the defender responds
