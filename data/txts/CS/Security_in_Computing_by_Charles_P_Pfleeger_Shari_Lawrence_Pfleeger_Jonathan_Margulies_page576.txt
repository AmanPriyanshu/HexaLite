DatabasesUse of massive amounts of data from varied sources is often referred to as 
big data. Big data differs from more conventional “small” data because big data comes from 

sources outside the company and is not generated solely by the organization’s own 

internal systems.  It can come from sensors and social media as well as video and audio 

recordings. It can come from government databases, market analytics, and customer 

reports. Every search query helps define trends of great value to companies. Social 

media give companies insight into 

what products, services, and prefer-

ences people are sharing with their 

friends.All these uses of data to predict behavior are valuable as companies decide how to 
allocate resources. So now the grocer does not merely look at a ten-day weather forecast 

but instead uses more data to predict with greater accuracy how many heads of lettuce 

will sell.Big data is becoming a big deal. And as with many highly popular technologies, func-
tionality outpaces security. In the next section we briefly describe the big data approach, 

point out some of its security limitations, and suggest potential countermeasures.A Big Data Application Framework: Apache HadoopAs shown in Figure 7-5, the conventional model of computing has users interacting with 
a processor that can access storage. To expand such a system, as shown in Figure 7-6, 

storage can be increased by addition of more disks to a disk array, for example. How-

ever, there is an implicit limit to how far storage can grow without suffering serious 

performance delays: At some point the biggest device on the market fills up and a dif-

ferent architecture is needed. A new processor can give greater speed, but again, exist-

ing technology has its limits, and higher performance tends to be disproportionately 

more expensive. Furthermore, one processor and one storage array become potential 

points of catastrophic failure. Big data requires an architecture that can readily scale to 

virtually unlimited capacity.
Data on activities or behavior abound. 
Are they accurate?
