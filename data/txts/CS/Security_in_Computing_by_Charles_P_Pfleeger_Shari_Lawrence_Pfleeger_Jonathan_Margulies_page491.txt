addresses in one network; the fil-

ter allows HTTP traffic but blocks 

traffic by using the Telnet protocol. 

Packet filters operate at OSI level 3.
Packet filters do not “see inside” a packet; they block or accept packets solely on 
the basis of the IP addresses and ports. Thus, any details in the packet’s data field (for 

example, allowing certain Telnet commands while blocking other services) is beyond 

the capability of a packet filter.
Packet filters can perform the important service of ensuring the validity of inside 
addresses. An inside host typically trusts other inside hosts precisely because they are 

not outsiders: Outside is uncontrolled and fraught with harmful creatures. But the only 
way an inside host can recognize another inside host is by the address shown in the 

source field of a message. Source addresses in packets can be forged, so an inside appli-

cation might think it was communicating with another host on the inside instead of an 

outside forger. A packet filter sits between the inside network and the outside net, so 

it can determine if a packet from the outside is forging an inside address, as shown in 

Figure 6-54.When we say the filter “sits between” two networks we really mean it connects to 
both the inside and outside networks, by two separate interface cards. The packet fil-

ter can easily distinguish inside from outside traffic based on which interface a packet 

arrived on.
A screening packet filter might be configured to block all packets from the outside 
that claimed their source address was an inside address. In this example, the packet 

filter blocks all packets claiming to come from any address of the form 100.50.25.x 
Packet filters—screening routers—limit 

traffic based on packet header data:
