 Section 10.4  Risk Analysis 
683  To supplement this tabular analysis, we can use a graphical depiction to contrast the 
economics involved in choosing among several strategies. For example, suppose we are 

considering the use of regression testing after making an upgrade to fix a security flaw. 

Regression testing means applying tests to verify that all remaining functions are unaf-

fected by the change. It can be an expensive process, especially for large systems that 

implement many functions. (This example is taken from Shari Lawrence Pfleeger and 

Joanne Atlee [PFL10a].) 
To help us decide, we draw a diagram such as that in Figure 10-2. We want to com-
pare the risk impact of doing regression testing with not doing it. Thus, the upper part 

of the diagram shows the risks in doing regression testing, and the lower part the risks 

of not doing regression testing. In each of the two cases, one of three things can hap-

pen: We find a critical fault, there is a critical fault but we miss finding it, or there are 

no critical faults to be found. For each possibility, we first calculate the probability of 

an unwanted outcome, P(UO). Then, we associate a loss with that unwanted outcome, 

L(UO). Thus, in our example, if we do regression testing and miss a critical fault lurk-

ing in the system (a probability of 0.05), the loss could be $30 million. Multiplying the 
two, we find the risk exposure for that strategy to be $1.5 million. As you can see from 

the calculations in the figure, doing the regression testing is safer than skipping it.
As shown in these examples, risk analysis can be used to evaluate the true costs 
of proposed controls. In this way, risk analysis can be used as a planning tool. The
