 Section 6.8  Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems 
475  Intrusion detection systems complement these preventive controls as the next line 
of defense. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device, typically another sepa-

rate computer, that monitors activity to identify malicious or suspicious events. Richard 

Kemmerer and Giovanni Vigna [KEM02] recount the history of IDSs. An IDS is a sen-

sor, like a smoke detector, that raises an alarm if specific things occur.
As with smoke alarms, detecting danger necessitates action. Whether the response is 
calling the fire department, activating a sprinkler system, sounding an evacuation alarm, 

or alerting the control team (or all of these) depends on what advance plans have been 

made to handle the incident. IDSs likewise have a response function. In many cases the 

response is to alert a human team that will then decide what further action is warranted. 

Sometimes, however, the IDS goes into protection mode to isolate a suspected intruder 

and constrain access. Such a system is called an Intrusion Protection System (IPS). We 

describe both IDS and IPS technology in this section.A model of an IDS is shown in Figure 6-64. The components in the figure are the 
four basic elements of an intrusion detection system, based on the Common Intrusion 
Detection Framework of [STA96]. An IDS receives raw inputs from sensors. It saves 

those inputs, analyzes them, and takes some controlling action.
IDSs perform a variety of functions:
• monitoring users and system activity
• auditing system configuration for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations
