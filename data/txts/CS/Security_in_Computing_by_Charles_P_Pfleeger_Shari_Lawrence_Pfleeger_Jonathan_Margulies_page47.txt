[BIB77]. Availability is security’s next great challenge.
We have just described the C-I-A triad and the three fundamental security prop-
erties it represents. Our description of these properties was in the context of things 

that need protection. To motivate your understanding we gave some examples of 

harm and threats to cause harm. Our next step is to think about the nature of threats  

themselves.
Types of Threats
For some ideas of harm, look at Figure 1-8, taken from Willis Ware’s report [WAR70]. 

Although it was written when computers were so big, so expensive, and so difficult to 

operate that only large organizations like universities, major corporations, or govern-

ment departments would have one, Ware’s discussion is still instructive today. Ware 

was concerned primarily with the protection of classified data, that is, preserving confi-

dentiality. In the figure, he depicts humans such as programmers and maintenance staff 

gaining access to data, as well as radiation by which data can escape as signals. From 
the figure you can see some of the many kinds of threats to a computer system.
One way to analyze harm is to consider the cause or source. We call a potential cause 
of harm a threat
. Harm can be 
caused by either nonhuman events 

or humans. Examples of nonhuman threats
 include natural disasters

Threats are caused both by human and 
other sources.
