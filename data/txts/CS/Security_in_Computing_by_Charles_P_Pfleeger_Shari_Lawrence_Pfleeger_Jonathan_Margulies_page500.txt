NetworksSIDEBAR 6-24 Poking a Hole in the Firewall
Firewalls have clear security benefits, but sometimes they prevent well-
intentioned users from accessing needed data and functions. For instance, 

firewalls usually prevent a user on one system from using the File Transfer 

Protocol (ftp) to upload or download files on another system. For this reason, 

someone inside the firewall sometimes “pokes a hole” through the firewall 

so that a trusted outsider can get in temporarily. Such a hole is actually an 

exception entered into the firewall policy rules. These holes allow files to be 

shared, applications to be accessed, and more. Technically called an SSH 

backdoor, the firewall hole can be set up in various ways. Once the outsider’s 

work is done, the insider closes up the hole and protection is restored. 
Some operating systems allow rules that intentionally breach firewalls. 
For example, Windows XP formally allows a user to create the hole by set-

ting “exceptions” on the administrative screen for the Windows firewall, 

shown in Figure 6-58. The exceptions can either open a port or, preferably, 

enable a specified program or service to have access within the firewall.
FIGURE 6-58 Firewall Exceptions
What are the downsides of such firewall breaches? They weaken the 
firewall, perhaps to the point of disabling it. Such breaches risk inadver-

tently allowing others (other than the traffic for which the exception is being 

created) to squeeze through the hole at the same time. So is it ethical to
