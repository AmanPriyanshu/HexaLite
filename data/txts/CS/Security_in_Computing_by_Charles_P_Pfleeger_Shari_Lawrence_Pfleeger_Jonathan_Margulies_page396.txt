Networksdirected or accidental. Data corruption can occur during data entry, in storage, during 
use and computation, in transit, and on output and retrieval. In this section we are inter-

ested in corruption as part of networked interaction.
Sometimes modification is blatant, making it readily apparent that a change has 
occurred (for example, complete deletion, which could be detected by a program, or 

replacement of text by binary data, which would be apparent to a human reader). Other 

times the alteration is subtle, such as the change of a single bit, which might allow pro-

cessing to continue, although perhaps producing incorrect results.Communications media are known to be vulnerable to data corruption. Simple 
 factors such as weather and trees can interfere with clean transmission. For this rea-

son, communications protocols include features to check for and correct, at least 

some, errors in transmission. The TCP/IP protocol suite (which we describe later 

in this chapter), is used for most 

Internet data communication. TCP/

IP has extensive features to ensure 

that the receiver gets a complete, 

correct, and well-ordered data 

stream, despite any errors during 

transmission.FIGURE 6-9 Data Corruption SourcesTyping

Network data corruption occurs 
naturally because of minor failures of 

transmission media. Corruption can also 
be induced for malicious purposes. Both 
must be controlled.
