6. “DoD Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria,” DoD Computer Security Cen-
ter, National Security Agency, Ft George G. Meade, Maryland; CSC-STD-001-83;  

Aug 15, 1983.7. So named because the cover of each document in the series had a unique and distinctively 
colored cover page. For example, the “Red Book” is “Trusted Network Interpretation,” 

National Computer Security Center, National Security Agency, Ft. George G. Meade, 

Maryland; NCSC-TG-005, July 31, 1987. USGPO Stock number 008-000-00486-2.8. “A Retrospective on the Criteria Movement,” Willis H. Ware; RAND, Santa Monica, CA;

plexity can be inferred by a study of Appendices A and B of R-609.1 (item [2] above).
