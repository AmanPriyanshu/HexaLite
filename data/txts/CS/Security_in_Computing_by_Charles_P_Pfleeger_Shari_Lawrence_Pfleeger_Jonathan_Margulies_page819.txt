 Section 12.2  Symmetric Encryption Algorithms 
785  Because these are networked communications, Zelda can see them in ciphertext 
form. Although she cannot interpret the content, she can look for similarities. Let us 

assume she knows where to look for the different fields. She will see two messages 

with the same encrypted destination account numbers and infer that those are probably 
the two transfers to her account. With that knowledge, she can create new messages, as 

shown in Figure 12-5, to transfer money from Annie and Carole to her account.

Without ever accessing the underlying plaintext, Zelda has fabricated two encrypted 
messages that might pass. (She still has a little more work to do to cover for her reuse of 

a previous transaction number.) The problem described here occurs because each plain-

text block is encrypted independently from all other blocks, so an attacker can reorder 

and substitute blocks undetected.The solution to this problem is called 
chaining. If the encryption of each block 
depends not only on the direct ciphertext of its distinct content but also on previous 

content, the order and position of each block in the chain is fixed. That change would 

prevent Zelda from reusing blocks from previous encryptions.
