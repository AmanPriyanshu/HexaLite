 Section 4.2  Web Attacks Targeting Users 
255  of these two firms. After correlating these data points, ClicksRUs can inform the florist 
and the bakery that they have common customers and might develop a joint marketing 

approach. Or ClicksRUs can determine that you went from florist A to florist B to flo-

rist C and back to florist A, so it can report to them that B and C lost out to A, helping 

them all develop more successful marketing strategies. Or ClicksRUs can infer that you 

are looking for a gift and will offer a targeted ad on the next site you visit. ClicksRUs 

might receive advertising revenue 

from florist D and trinket merchant 

E, which would influence the ads it 

will display to you. Web bugs and 

tracking services are big business, as 

we explain in Chapter 9.
Web bugs can also be used in email with images. A spammer gets a list of email 
addresses but does not know if the addresses are active, that is, if anyone reads mail at 

that address. With an embedded web bug, the spammer receives a report when the email 

message is opened in a browser. Or a company suspecting its email is ending up with 

competitors or other unauthorized parties can insert a web bug that will report each time 

the message is opened, whether as a direct recipient or someone to whom the message 
has been forwarded.
Tiny action points called web bugs can 
report page traversal patterns to central 

collecting points, compromising privacy.
