ariseProxying leads to a slightly different configuration. The proxy host–firewall com-
municates with both internal systems and the outside because it looks like an internal 

host to the outside.Examples of proxied applications include email, web page service, and file transfer. 
A common situation provides a more-detailed example—a proxy application for web 

page servers: A company has an internal web structure, with pages describing products, 

customers, and perhaps internal contact information. The company maintains a pro-

tected database of products, including stock on hand, but the company does not want to 

release exactly how many units of a product are on hand. Thus, each time the system is 

ready to display a product’s page, the firewall queries the database and, according to the 

result obtained, adds a line saying “available now,” “a few left,” or “out of stock.” The 

firewall serves as a user’s proxy to access the database on behalf of the outside user but 

limits the information returned from the query.
