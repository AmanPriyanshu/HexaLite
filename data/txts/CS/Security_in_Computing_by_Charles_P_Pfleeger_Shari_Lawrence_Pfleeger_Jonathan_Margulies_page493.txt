at 01:37.26. When the probe against port 2 arrives, the firewall may record the second 

connection from 100.200.3.4, at 01:37.29. After two more connections at 01:37.34 and 

01:37.36, the next connection at 01:37.39 meets the firewallâ€™s rule for number of differ-

ent ports in a short time, so it activates the rule to block connections from 100.200.3.4, 

as shown in Figure 6-55. The firewall progresses through several states (the count of 

connection requests from address 100.200.3.4) from different packets until the count 

exceeds the threshold for acceptable behavior. The name stateful inspection refers to 

accumulating threat evidence across multiple packets.
One classic approach used by attackers is to break an attack into multiple packets 
by forcing some packets to have very short lengths so that a firewall cannot detect the 

characteristic of an attack split across two or more packets. A stateful inspection fire-

wall would track the sequence of packets and conditions from one packet to another to 

thwart such an attack.
Application Proxy
Packet filters look only at the headers of packets, not at the data inside the packets. 
Therefore, a packet filter would pass anything to port 25, assuming its screening rules 

allow inbound connections to that port. But applications are complex and sometimes 

contain errors. Worse, applications (such as the email delivery agent) often act on behalf 

of all users, so they require privileges of all users (for example, to store incoming mail
