36Chapter topics:• Authentication, capabilities, and limitations
• The three bases of authentication: knowledge, charac-
teristics, possessions• Strength of an authentication mechanism

• Implementation of access control

• Employing encryption

• Symmetric and asymmetric encryption

• Message digests

• Signatures and certificates
Just as doctors have stethoscopes and carpenters have measuring tapes and squares, 

security professionals have tools they use frequently. Three of these security tools 

are authentication, access control, and cryptography. In this chapter we introduce 
these tools, and in later chapters we use these tools repeatedly to address a wide range 

of security issues.In some sense, security hasn’t changed since sentient beings began accumulating 
things worth protecting. A system owner establishes a security policy, formally or infor-

mally, explicitly or implicitly—perhaps as simple as “no one is allowed to take my 

food”—and begins taking measures to enforce that policy. The character of the threats 

changes as the protagonist moves from the jungle to the medieval battlefield to the mod-

ern battlefield to the Internet, as does the nature of the available protections, but their 

strategic essence remains largely constant: An attacker wants something a defender has, 

so the attacker goes after it. The defender has a number of options—fight, build a barrier 

or alarm system, run and hide, diminish the target’s attractiveness to the attacker—and
