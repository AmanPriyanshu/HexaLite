Legal Issues and EthicsSpecial CasesIn this section we consider some special cases of computer objects warranting legal 
protection of some sort.Computer Source or Object Code
Source code, probably the thing most important to secure with legal protection, is prob-
ably the murkiest. Source code can be protected by patent as long as the developer 

can present a convincing case that the underlying algorithm is novel. So a simple sort 

procedure would not be novel because the technique is well known. Computer source 

or object code can also be protected as intellectual property under copyright. However, 

that protection applies only to the reproductions of the code, not to a variation of the 

concept. In text, copying and reselling an entire article violates copyright, extracting a 

small amount verbatim is acceptable use, and paraphrasing an idea is perfectly accept-

able. Extending those notions to computer code, however, leads to the conclusion that 

reselling a copy of a piece of software is a violation, but rewriting a piece of code, that 

is, reimplementing the same algorithm, is within the limits of copyright law. Such a 

conclusion does not provide satisfactory protection for software.
Web Content
Content on the web is media, much the same as a book or photograph, so the most 
appropriate protection for it is copyright. This copyright would also protect software
