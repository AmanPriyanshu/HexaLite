Privacycompanies in the network agree to share data with DoubleClick. Geary [GEA12] points 
out that DoubleClick profits from three activities:
• Ad serving. DoubleClick displays the advertisements on the customer’s website.
• Ad delivery. DoubleClick enables advertisers to control how often an advertise-
ment is shown and for how long each showing lasts.
• Behavioral targeting
. For one website owner, the publisher sets a cookie to find 
out what parts of the site a customer is browsing. Then DoubleClick matches the 

advertisements to the interests demonstrated by the customer’s browsing habits. 

But DoubleClick has also formed a division called AdSense, which forms net-

works of advertisers that pool the information they gather, enabling each mem-

ber of the network to fine-tune targeting advertising.
So, in essence, DoubleClick knows where you have been, where you are going, and 
what other ads are placed. But because it gets to read and write its cookies, it can record 
all this information for future use.Google’s privacy policy describes what a generic DoubleClick cookie looks like:
• time: 01/Jan/2015 12:01:00
• ad_placement_id: 103 (the ID of where the advertisement was viewed on the 
website)• ad_id: 1234 (the unique ID of the advertisement)

• userid: 0000000000000001 (the unique number the cookie has given your 
browser)
• client_ip: 123.45.67.89

• referral_url: http://youtube.com/categories (the page where you saw the 
advertisement)
Geary points out, “because it records your IP address, DoubleClick can also make a 
good guess of your country and town/city, too.”
Here are examples of other things a third-party cookie can do:
• Count the number of times this browser has viewed a particular web page.
• Track the pages a visitor views within a site or across different sites.

• Count the number of times a particular ad has appeared.

• Match visits to a site with displays of an ad for that site.

• Match a purchase to an ad a person viewed before making the purchase.

• Record and report search strings from a search engine.
Of course, all these counting and matching activities produce statistics that the cook-
ie’s site can also send back to the central site any time the cookie is activated. And these 

collected data are also available to send to any other partners of the cookie’s network. 
To see in detail how third-party cookies work, assume you visit a personal-investing 
page that, being financed by advertising, contains spaces for ads from four stockbro-

kers. Let us also assume that eight possible brokers could fill these four ad slots. When 

the page is loaded, DoubleClick retrieves its cookie, sees that you have been to that
