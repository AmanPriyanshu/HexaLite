404 Chapter 6  
Networksattacks may be difficult to detect or block on the receiving host. But peculiarities or 
oversights in the protocols or their implementations can open the way for an attacker to 

exploit a weakness to overwhelm the code supporting the protocol function. We exam-

ine how these protocols can be used to attack a victim. And we stress that packets are 

unauthenticated: An attacker can use ping or echo packets to saturate a network just as 

readily as an administrator uses them to manage network performance.
Ping of DeathA ping of death
 is a simple attack, using the ping command that is ordinarily used 
to test response time from a host. Since ping requires the recipient to respond to the 

packet, all the attacker needs to do is send a flood of pings to the intended victim. 

The attack is limited by the smallest bandwidth on the attack route, as shown in Fig-

ure 6-18. If the attacker is on a 10-megabyte (MB) connection and the path to the victim 

is 100 MB or more, mathematically the attacker alone cannot flood the victim. But the 

attack succeeds if the numbers are reversed: The attacker on a 100-MB connection can 

certainly flood a 10-MB victim. The ping packets will saturate the victimâ€™s bandwidth.
SmurfThe smurf attack is a variation of a ping attack. It uses the same vehicle, a ping packet, 
with two extra twists. First, the attacker chooses a network of unwitting victims that 

become accomplices. The attacker spoofs the source address in the ping packet so that 

it appears to come from the victim, which means a recipient will respond to the victim. 
Then, the attacker sends this request to the network in broadcast mode by setting the last 

byte of the address to all 1s; broadcast mode packets are distributed to all hosts on the
