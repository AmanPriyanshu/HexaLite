 Section 8.3  Cloud Security Tools and Techniques 
565  file a customer uploads to the cloud. It then encrypts the file key by using the customer’s 
unique RSA public key, and stores the encrypted file key with the encrypted file. When a 

customer wants to retrieve and decrypt a file from cloud storage, the client uses the cus-

tomer’s RSA private key to decrypt the file key, and the file key to decrypt the file. The 

nice feature of this approach is that it naturally lends itself to file sharing: If a customer 

wants to share a file with a friend, the Boxcryptor client can encrypt a second copy of 

the file key by using the friend’s RSA public key. This can be repeated with minimal 

storage cost for more users or groups. Interestingly, but perhaps not surprisingly, the 

malware known as Cryptolocker, which encrypts victims’ files and holds them hostage in 

exchange for a ransom, uses essentially the same encryption scheme.
Data Loss Prevention
Data Loss Prevention, or DLP, as described in Chapter 6, can be difficult to accomplish 
with cloud storage. Part of the way DLP products protect companies from losing sensi-

tive data is by providing appliances that monitor and block traffic at network boundar-

ies. When a company moves data and services to a public cloud, users can access them 

from outside the company network, completely bypassing those network boundaries.
One way to maintain DLP capability when moving to a public cloud is to force users 
to go through the company network to get there. Many cloud services give customer 

companies options to restrict users by source IP address. If a user attempts to log in to 
the cloud service from home or elsewhere without having an open VPN connection to 

the company network (that is, without having a company-owned source IP address), the
