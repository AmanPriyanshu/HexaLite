Programs and Programming• The malicious code is easy to create.
• The malicious code is machine independent and operating system independent.
Few examples of malware meet all these criteria. The writer chooses from these objec-
tives when deciding what the code will do and where it will reside.
Just a few years ago, the challenge for the virus writer was to write code that would 
be executed repeatedly so that the virus could multiply. Now, however, one execution is 

usually enough to ensure widespread distribution. Many kinds of malware are transmit-

ted by email. For example, some examples of malware generate a new email message 

to all addresses in the victim’s address book. These new messages contain a copy of the 

malware so that it propagates widely. Often the message is a brief, chatty, nonspecific 

message that would encourage the new recipient to open the attachment from a friend 

(the first recipient). For example, the subject line or message body may read “I thought 

you might enjoy this picture from our vacation.”
One-Time Execution (Implanting) 
Malicious code often executes a one-time process to transmit or receive and install the 

infection. Sometimes the user clicks to download a file, other times the user opens an 

attachment, and other times the malicious code is downloaded silently as a web page is 

displayed. In any event, this first step to acquire and install the code must be quick and 

not obvious to the user.
