Programs and ProgrammingMemory-Resident Viruses 
Some parts of the operating system and most user programs execute, terminate, and dis-

appear, with their space in memory then being available for anything executed later. For 

frequently used parts of the operating system and for a few specialized user programs, 

it would take too long to reload the program each time it is needed. Instead, such code 

remains in memory and is called “resident” code. Examples of resident code are the 

routine that interprets keys pressed on the keyboard, the code that handles error condi-

tions that arise during a program’s execution, or a program that acts like an alarm clock, 

sounding a signal at a time the user determines. Resident routines are sometimes called 
TSRs or “terminate and stay resident” routines.Virus writers also like to attach viruses to resident code because the resident code is 
activated many times while the machine is running. Each time the resident code runs, 

the virus does too. Once activated, the virus can look for and infect uninfected carriers. 

For example, after activation, a boot sector virus might attach itself to a piece of resi-

dent code. Then, each time the virus was activated, it might check whether any remov-

able disk in a disk drive was infected and, if not, infect it. In this way the virus could 

spread its infection to all removable disks used during the computing session.
A virus can also modify the operating system’s table of programs to run. Once the 
virus gains control, it can insert a registry entry so that it will be reinvoked each time 

the system restarts. In this way, even if the user notices and deletes the executing copy 

of the virus from memory, the system will resurrect the virus on the next system restart.
For general malware, executing just once from memory has the obvious disadvan-
tage of only one opportunity to cause malicious behavior, but on the other hand, if the
