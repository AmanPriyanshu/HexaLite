 Section 7.1  Introduction to Databases 
505  project the results onto the attributes NAME and FIRST, as in Table 7-5. The result is 
the list of first and last names of people whose addresses have zip code 43210.
Notice that we do not have to project onto the same attribute(s) on which the selec-
tion is done. For example, we can build a query using ZIP and NAME but project the 

result onto FIRST:
SHOW FIRST WHERE (ZIP='43210') ^ (NAME='ADAMS')The result would be a list of the first names of people whose last names are 
ADAMS
 and 
ZIP is 43210.We can also merge two subschema on a common element by using a 
join query. 
The result of this operation is a subschema whose records have the same value for 

the common element. For example, Figure 7-2 shows that the subschema NAME–ZIP 

and the subschema ZIP–AIRPORT 

can be joined on the common field 

ZIP to produce the subschema 

NAME–AIRPORT.
