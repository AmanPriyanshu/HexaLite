NetworksA typical architecture for this situation is shown in Figure 6-61. The web page server, 
also known as a bastion host, is on its own LAN, isolated from the main internal LAN 

by a second firewall.
The same architecture can be extended, as shown in Figure 6-62. In this figure, the 
externally accessible services, such 

as web pages, email, and file trans-

fer, are on servers in the 
demilita-rized zone or 
DMZ, named after 
the military buffer space, sometimes 

called the “no man’s land,” between 

the territories held by two compet-

ing armies. In all these examples, the network architecture is critical. A firewall can protect only 
what it can control, so if a subnetwork has external connections not screened by the 

firewall, the firewall cannot control traffic on that unscreened connection. An example 

is a device with its own direct Internet connection (perhaps a rogue wireless connec-

tion). As we saw earlier in this chapter, visibility to one device, perhaps via the wireless 

connection mentioned here, can give an attacker visibility and access to other devices. 

For this reason, the only path to every protected network device must pass through the 

network’s firewall.
Although these examples are simplifications, they show the kinds of configurations 
firewalls protect. Next, we review the kinds of attacks against which firewalls can and 

cannot protect.FirewallWeb page serverDatabaseFirewallFIGURE 6-61 Application ProxyOutside users can access tools and data in a firewall’s demilitarized zone but 

cannot get to more sensitive resources 

on the more protected inside network.
