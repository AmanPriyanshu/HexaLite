 Section 4.2  Web Attacks Targeting Users 
249  Fake CodeIn Chapter 3 we considered malicious codeâ€”its sources, effects, and countermeasures. 
We described how opening a document or clicking a link can lead to a surreptitious 

download of code that does nothing obvious but installs a hidden infection. One trans-

mission route we did not note was an explicit download: programs intentionally installed 

that may advertise one purpose but do something entirely different. Figure 4-8 shows 
a seemingly authentic ad for a replacement or update to the popular Adobe Reader. 

The link from which it came (www.pdf-new-2010-download.com) was redirected from 

www.adobe-download-center.com; both addresses seem like the kinds of URLs Adobe 

might use to distribute legitimate software.
Whether this attack is meant just to deceive or to harm depends on what code is 
actually delivered. This example shows how malicious software can masquerade as 

legitimate. The charade can continue unnoticed for some time if the malware at least 

seems to implement its ostensible function, in this case, displaying and creating PDF 
documents. Perhaps the easiest way for a malicious code writer to install code on a 

target machine is to create an application that a user willingly downloads and installs. 

As we describe in Chapter 13, smartphone apps are well suited for distributing false or 

misleading code because of the large number of young, trusting smartphone users.
