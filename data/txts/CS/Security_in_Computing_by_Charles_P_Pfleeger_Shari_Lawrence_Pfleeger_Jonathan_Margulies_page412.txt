NetworksOn the other hand, antennas can be tuned to the frequency of wireless communica-
tion. Focusing directly on the source of a signal can also improve reception at great 

distance. In Table 6-2 we estimate some reasonable ranges for different WiFi protocols. 

Experimental results with 802.11n have demonstrated reception at distances of approxi-

mately 5000 ft/1600 m in ideal conditions. Most WiFi-enabled computers now communicate on the 802.11n protocol (and for 
compatibility on all earlier ones, as well), so the range is easily from one house to the 

street, and even a few houses away in a conventional neighborhood. As described in 

Sidebar 6-10, Google embarked on an adventurous project to map WiFi connectivity all 

over the world. The objective of this mapping is not obvious, but the European Union 

determined that Google was stepping over a line in collecting these data.

SIDEBAR 6-10 Google’s Street View Project
Google’s Street View project, launched in 2007, involved cars with cameras 
driving the streets of various cities to capture photographs of street scenes. 

These images were combined with GPS coordinates to fix each image to its 

physical location.According to the Electronic Privacy Information Center [EPI10], while 
photographing scenes along these streets, Google’s cars also operated 

wireless network scanners and receivers, ran programs to select unen-

crypted network traffic encountered, and wrote that content to computer 

disks, along with the GPS coordinates at which the signal was received. 

Some of that data included email account passwords and email mes-

sages. Google also intercepted and saved network device identifiers 

(MAC addresses) and wireless network station identifiers (SSIDs) from 

wireless networks it detected from the streets. Wireless addresses com-

bined with physical location could be used to deliver targeted advertising. 

An independent audit of the programs, commissioned by Google, [STR10] 

documents the syntactic analysis of collected data to be able to store 

individual fields.
