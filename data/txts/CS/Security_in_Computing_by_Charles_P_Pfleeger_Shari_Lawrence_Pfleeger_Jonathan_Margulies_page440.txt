Networksexchange to demonstrate a clear and complete communication channel by sending a 
packet with the ACK bit on, as shown in Figure 6-21.
Occasionally packets get lost or damaged in transmission. The destination (which 
we call the recipient) maintains a queue called the SYN_RECV connections, tracking 
those items for which a SYN–ACK has been sent but no corresponding ACK has yet 

been received. Normally, these connections are completed in a short time. If the SYN–

ACK (2) or the ACK (3) packet is lost, eventually the destination host will time out the 

incomplete connection and discard it from its waiting queue.
The attacker can deny service to the target by sending many SYN requests, to which 
the target properly responds with SYN-ACK; however, the attacker never replies with 

ACKs to complete the connections, thereby filling the victim’s SYN_RECV queue. 

Typically, the SYN_RECV queue is quite small, holding 10 or 20 entries. Because of 

potential routing delays in the Internet, typical holding times for the SYN_RECV queue 
can be minutes. So the attacker need only send a new SYN request every few seconds, 

and the queue will fill.
Attackers using this approach usually do one more thing: They spoof a nonexistent 
return address in the initial SYN packet. Why? For two reasons. First, the attacker does 

not want to disclose the real source address in case someone should inspect the packets
