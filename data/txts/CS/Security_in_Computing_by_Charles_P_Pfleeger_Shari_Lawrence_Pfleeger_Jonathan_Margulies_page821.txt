 Section 12.2  Symmetric Encryption Algorithms 
787  Questions About the Security of DESSince its first announcement, there has been controversy concerning the security pro-
vided by DES. Although much of this controversy has appeared in the open literature, 

certain features of DES have neither been revealed by the designers nor inferred by 

outside analysts.Design of the AlgorithmInitially, there was concern with the basic algorithm itself. During development of the 

algorithm, the National Security Agency (NSA) indicated that key elements of the algo-

rithm design were “sensitive” and would not be made public. These elements include 

the rationale behind transformations by the S-boxes, the P-boxes, and the key changes. 

There are many possibilities for the S-box substitutions, but one particular set was cho-

sen for DES.Two issues arose about the design’s secrecy. The first involved a fear that certain 
“trapdoors” had been imbedded in the DES algorithm so that a covert, easy means was 

available to decrypt any DES-encrypted message. For instance, such trapdoors would 

give the NSA the ability to inspect private communications.
After a Congressional inquiry, the results of which are classified, an unclassified 
summary exonerated the NSA from any improper involvement in the DES design. (For 

a good discussion on the design of DES, see [SMI88a].)The second issue addressed the possibility that a design flaw would be (or perhaps 
has been) discovered by a cryptanalyst, this time giving an interceptor the ability to 

access private communications.
Both Bell Laboratories [MOR77] and the Lexan Corporation [LEX76]
 scrutinized the operation (not the design) of the S-boxes. Neither analysis revealed any weakness 

that impairs the proper functioning of the S-boxes. The DES algorithm has been studied 

extensively and, to date, no serious flaws have been published.
In response to criticism, the NSA released certain information on the selection of the S-boxes ([KON81, BRA77]).
• No S-box is a linear or affine function of its input; that is, the four output bits 
cannot be expressed as a system of linear equations of the six input bits.
