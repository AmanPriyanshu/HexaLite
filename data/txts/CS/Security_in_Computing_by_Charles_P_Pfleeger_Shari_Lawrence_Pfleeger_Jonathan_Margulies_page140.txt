 3a. 
Malvolio intercepts this message and obtains and holds the symmetric key Amy 
has generated. 3b. 
Malvolio generates a new symmetric key and sends it to Bill, with a message 
purportedly from Amy: Thanks. I have generated a symmetric key for us to use 

for this interchange. I am sending you the symmetric key encrypted under your 

public key.
In summary, Malvolio now holds two symmetric encryption keys, one each shared 
with Amy and Bill. Not only can Malvolio stealthily obtain all their interchanges, but 

Amy and Bill cannot communicate securely with each other because neither shares a 

key with the other.
From this point on, all communications pass through Malvolio. Having both sym-
metric keys, Malvolio can decrypt anything received, modify it, encrypt it under the 

other key, and transmit the modified version to the other party. Neither Amy nor Bill is 

aware of the switch. This attack is a type of 
man-in-the-middle4 failure, in which an 
unauthorized third party intercedes in an activity presumed to be exclusively between 

two people. See Sidebar 2-15 for an example of a real-world man-in-the-middle attack.

4. Alas, this terminology is hopelessly sexist. Even if we called these attacks person-in-the-middle or intrud-
er-in-the-middle in this book, you would find only the term man-in-the-middle used by other writers, who 

also use terms like man-in-the-browser and man-in-the-phone, which arise in Chapter 4 of this book. Thus, 

we are regrettably stuck with the conventional term.
