Toolbox: Authentication, Access Control, and Cryptography
• Revocation. 
To revoke one user’s access right to an object, someone must change 
the password, thereby causing the same problems as disclosure.
• Loss. Depending on how the passwords are implemented, it may be impossible 
to retrieve a lost or forgotten password. The operators or system administrators 

can certainly intervene and provide a new password, but often they cannot deter-

mine what password a user had chosen previously. If the user loses (or forgets) 

the password, administrators must assign a new one.
Attacking and Protecting Passwords
How secure are passwords themselves? Passwords are somewhat limited as protec-
tion devices because of the relatively small number of bits of information they contain. 

Worse, people pick passwords that do not even take advantage of the number of bits 

available: Choosing a well-known string, such as qwerty, password, or 123456 reduces 

an attacker’s uncertainty or difficulty essentially to zero.
Knight and Hartley [KNI98] list, in order, 12 steps an attacker might try in order 
to determine a password. These steps are in increasing degree of difficulty (number of 

guesses), and so they indicate the amount of work to which the attacker must go in order 

to derive a password. Here are their password guessing steps:
• no password
• the same as the user ID

• is, or is derived from, the user’s name

• on a common word list (for example, password, secret, private) plus common 
names and patterns (for example, qwerty, aaaaaa)
• contained in a short college dictionary

• contained in a complete English word list

• contained in common non-English-language dictionaries

• contained in a short college dictionary with capitalizations (PaSsWorD) or sub-
stitutions (digit 0 for letter O, and so forth)• contained in a complete English dictionary with capitalizations or substitutions

• contained in common non-English dictionaries with capitalization or substitutions

• obtained by brute force, trying all possible combinations of alphabetic characters

• obtained by brute force, trying all possible combinations from the full 
character setAlthough the last step will always 
succeed, the steps immediately pre-

ceding it are so time consuming that 

they will deter all but the most dedi-

cated attacker for whom time is not a 

limiting factor.
We now expand on some of these approaches.
Every password can be guessed; 

password strength is determined by 

how many guesses are required.
