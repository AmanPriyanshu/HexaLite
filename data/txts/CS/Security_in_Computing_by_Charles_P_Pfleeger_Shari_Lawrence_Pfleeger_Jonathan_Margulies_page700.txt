Management and Incidents• coordination centers to coordinate incident response activity across organiza-
tions, so that work is not duplicated unnecessarily and efforts proceed toward 

the same goals• so-called national CSIRTs with coordination responsibility within a country and 
to national CSIRTs of other countries
• sector CSIRTs to assist with investigating and handling incidents specific to a 
particular business sector, for example, financial institutions or medical facili-

ties; some attacks focus on one type of target (for example, in 2013 large banks 

were the target of massive denial-of-service attacks)
• vendor CSIRTs to address or participate in incidents involving one manufac-
turer’s products
• outsourced CSIRT teams, 
hired to perform incident 

response services on con-

tract to other companiesA related concept is the security operations center (SOC), which performs the day-to-day monitoring of a network and may be the first to detect and report an unusual 

situation. Also, information sharing and analysis centers (ISACs) perform some CSIRT 

functions by sharing threat and incident data across CSIRTs.
CSIRT Activity
Responsibilities of a CSIRT include:
• Reporting: receiving reports of suspected incidents and reporting as appropriate 
to senior management• Detection: investigation to determine if an incident occurred
• Triage
: immediate action to address urgent needs
• Response: coordination of effort to address all aspects in a manner appropriate 
to severity and time demands
• Post-mortem
: declaring the incident over and arranging to review the case to 
improve future response
• Education: preventing harm by advising on good security practices and dissemi-
nating lessons learned from past incidentsThe proactive role of a CSIRT in preventing attacks is increasing in importance, 
reports Robin Ruefle’s team [RUE14]. Teams study current data to predict future attack 

trends as a way to determine where to invest preventive resources.
Team Membership
Not uncommonly the incident response team of a large organization has 50 or more 
members.At different times response teams need a variety of skills, including the ability to
• collect, analyze, and preserve digital forensic evidence
• analyze data to infer trends
CSIRTs operate in organizations, 
nationally, internationally, by vendor, 

and by business sector.
