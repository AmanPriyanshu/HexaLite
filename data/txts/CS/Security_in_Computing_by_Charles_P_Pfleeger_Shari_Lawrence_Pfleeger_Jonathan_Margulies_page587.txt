 Section 8.2  Moving to the Cloud 
553  services. A hybrid cloud
 is composed of two or more types of clouds, connected by 
technology that enables data and applications to be moved around the infrastructure to 

balance loads among clouds.Thus, cloud software is not business as usual. It must provide services without 
anchoring in a particular location. It must also be highly modular, with low coupling 

and easy interoperability—all characteristics of good code, as discussed in Chapter 3.8.2 MOVING TO THE CLOUD
Before moving functionality or data to a cloud, it is important to consider pros and cons. 

Moving to a cloud can be difficult and expensive, and it can be equally expensive to 

undo. While every cloud offering presents its own set of risks and benefits, a number of 

guidelines can help you understand whether your functions and data should be migrated 
to a cloud environment, as well as which cloud offerings will be most likely to meet 

your security needs.Risk AnalysisRisk analysis should be a part of any major security decision, including a move to cloud 

services. We discuss risk analysis in detail in Chapter 10, but for now, here are the high-

level steps, along with a brief discussion of how each applies to adopting cloud services:
1. Identify assets. Moving to a cloud service generally means moving functionality and 
data. It is important that you document every function and data type that might move 

to the cloud service, since it’s easy to lose track and miss something important.
