Programs and Programming2014, for example, there were eight adware attacks (ads offering useless or malicious 
programs for sale), and nine Trojan horses or Trojan horse transmitters in the top 20, 

and two exploit script attacks, which we also describe in this chapter. But the top attack 

type, comprising 81.73 percent of attacks, was malicious URLs, described in the next 

chapter. A different measure counts the number of pieces of malicious code Kasper-

sky products found on protected computers (that is, malware not blocked by Kasper-

sky’s email and Internet activity screens). Among the top 20 types of malware were five 
TABLE 3-2 
Types of Malicious Code
Code TypeCharacteristics
Virus
Code that causes malicious behavior and propagates copies of itself to other programs
Trojan horse
Code that contains unexpected, undocumented, additional functionality
Worm
Code that propagates copies of itself through a network; impact is usually degraded 
performanceRabbit
Code that replicates itself without limit to exhaust resources
Logic bombCode that triggers action when a predetermined condition occursTime bomb
Code that triggers action when a predetermined time occursDropper
Transfer agent code only to drop other malicious code, such as virus or Trojan horse
Hostile mobile code agentCode communicated semi-autonomously by programs transmitted through the webScript attack, JavaScript, 
Active code attack
Malicious code communicated in JavaScript, ActiveX, or another scripting language, 
downloaded as part of displaying a web page
RAT (remote access Trojan)
Trojan horse that, once planted, gives access from remote location
Spyware
Program that intercepts and covertly communicates data on the user or the user’s 
activity
BotSemi-autonomous agent, under control of a (usually remote) controller or “herder”; not necessarily maliciousZombieCode or entire computer under control of a (usually remote) programBrowser hijacker
Code that changes browser settings, disallows access to certain sites, or redirects 
browser to others
RootkitCode installed in “root” or most privileged section of operating system; hard to detect
Trapdoor or backdoor
Code feature that allows unauthorized access to a machine or program; bypasses 
normal access control and authenticationTool or toolkit
Program containing a set of tests for vulnerabilities; not dangerous itself, but each 
successful test identifies a vulnerable host that can be attacked
Scareware
Not code; false warning of malicious code attack
