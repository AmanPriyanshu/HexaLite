user has to recognize the string and type it into an input box. Distortions are intended to 
defeat optical character recognition software that might be able to extract the characters. 

(Figure 4-5 shows an amusing spoof of CAPTCHA puzzles.) The line is fine between 

what a human can still interpret and what is too distorted for pattern recognizers to 

handle, as described in Sidebar 4-1.Sites offering free email accounts, such as Yahoo mail and Hotmail, use CAPTCHAs 
in their account creation phase to ensure that only individual humans obtain accounts.
