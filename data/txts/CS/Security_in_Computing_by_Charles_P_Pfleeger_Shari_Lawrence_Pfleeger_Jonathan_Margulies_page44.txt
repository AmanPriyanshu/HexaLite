IntroductionIntegrityExamples of integrity failures are easy to find. A number of years ago a malicious 
macro in a Word document inserted the word “not” after some random instances of the 

word “is;” you can imagine the havoc that ensued. Because the document was generally 

syntactically correct, people did not immediately detect the change. In another case, a 
model of the Pentium computer chip produced an incorrect result in certain circum-

stances of floating-point arithmetic. Although the circumstances of failure were rare, 

Intel decided to manufacture and replace the chips. Many of us receive mail that is 

misaddressed because someone typed something wrong when transcribing from a writ-
ten list. A worse situation occurs when that inaccuracy is propagated to other mailing 

lists such that we can never seem to correct the root of the problem. Other times we find 

that a spreadsheet seems to be wrong, only to find that someone typed “space 123” in a 

cell, changing it from a numeric value to text, so the spreadsheet program misused that 

cell in computation. Suppose someone converted numeric data to roman numerals: One 

could argue that IV is the same as 4, but IV would not be useful in most applications, 

nor would it be obviously meaningful to someone expecting 4 as an answer. These cases 

show some of the breadth of examples of integrity failures. 
Integrity is harder to pin down than confidentiality. As Stephen Welke and Terry 
Mayfield [WEL90, MAY91, NCS91a] point out, integrity means different things in dif-

ferent contexts. When we survey the way some people use the term, we find several
