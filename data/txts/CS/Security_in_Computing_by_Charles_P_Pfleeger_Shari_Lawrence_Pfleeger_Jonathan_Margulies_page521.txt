• Filter in real time, online.

• Hide its presence.

• Use optimal sliding-time window size to match signatures.
Stealth ModeAn IDS is a network device (or, in the case of a host-based IDS, a program running on a 
network device). Any network device is potentially vulnerable to network attacks. How 

useful would an IDS be if it were deluged with a denial-of-service attack? If an attacker 

succeeded in logging in to a system within the protected network, wouldn’t trying to 

disable the IDS be the next step?
To counter those problems, most IDSs run in 
stealth mode, whereby an IDS has two 
network interfaces: one for the network (or network segment) it is monitoring and the 

other to generate alerts and perhaps perform other administrative needs. The IDS uses 

the monitored interface as input only; it never sends packets out through that interface. 

Often, the interface is configured so that the device has no published address through 

the monitored interface; that is, no router can route anything directly to that address 

because the router does not know such a device exists. It is the perfect passive wire-

tap. If the IDS needs to generate an 
alert, it uses only the alarm interface 

on a completely separate control 

network. Such an architecture is 

shown in Figure 6-66.
Stealth mode IDS prevents the attacker 

from knowing an alarm has been raised.
