Networks(but, of course, it permits in any packets with destination 100.50.25.x). A packet filter 
accepts or rejects solely according to the header information—address, size, protocol 
type—of each packet by itself. Such processing is simple, efficient, and fast, so a packet 

filtering firewall often serves as a sturdy doorkeeper to quickly eliminate obviously 

unwanted traffic.
The primary disadvantage of packet filtering routers is a combination of simplicity 
and complexity. The router’s inspection is simplistic; to perform sophisticated filtering, 

the rules set needs to be very detailed. A detailed rules set will be complex and therefore 

prone to error. For example, blocking all port 23 traffic (Telnet) is simple and straight-

forward. But if some Telnet traffic is to be allowed, each IP address from which it is 

allowed must be specified in the rules; in this way, the rule set can become very long.
Stateful Inspection Firewall
Filtering firewalls work on packets one at a time, accepting or rejecting each packet and 
moving on to the next. They have no 

concept of “state” or “context” from 

one packet to the next. A 
stateful 
inspection firewall
 maintains state 
information from one packet to 

another in the input stream.Recall the description of observing probes against ports 1, 2, 3, 4, and so forth; that activity is an example of the use of a stateful inspection firewall. By itself, a probe 

against port 1 is meaningless: It is most likely a legitimate attempt to connect to the 

service of port 1 or a single mistake, but it could also signal the start of a port scan
