 Section 7.4  Database Disclosure 
533  When one cell is suppressed in a table with totals for rows and columns, it is neces-
sary to suppress at least one additional cell on the row and one on the column to confuse 

a snooper. Using this logic, all cells (except totals) would have to be suppressed in this 

small sample table. When totals are not presented, single cells in a row or column can 

be suppressed.Combined Results Another control combines rows or columns to protect sensitive values. For example, 

Table 7-13 shows several sensitive results that identify single individuals. (Even though 

these counts may not seem sensitive, someone could use them to infer sensitive data 

such as NAME; therefore, we consider them to be sensitive.)
These counts, combined with other results such as sum, permit us to infer individual 
drug-use values for the three males, as well as to infer that no female was rated 3 for 

drug use. To suppress such sensitive information, one can combine the attribute val-

ues for 0 and 1, and also for 2 and 3, producing the less sensitive results shown in 

Table 7-14. In this instance, it is impossible to identify any single value.
Another way of combining results is to present values in 
ranges. For example, 
instead of exact financial aid figures being released, results can be released for the 

ranges $0–1999, $2000–3999, and $4000 and above. Even if only one record is rep-

resented by a single result, the exact value of that record is not known. Similarly, the 

highest and lowest financial aid values are concealed.
Yet another method of combining is by 
rounding
. This technique is actually a fairly 
well known example of combining by range. If numbers are rounded to the nearest 

multiple of 10, the effective ranges are 0–5, 6–15, 16–25, and so on. Actual values are 

rounded up or down to the nearest multiple of some base.
