 Section 6.6  Cryptography in Network Security 
449  Now consider the second case of a telecommuter: Jeannie, an employee working 
from home. To be productive from home she needs to use central files and resources 

she could access easily from the office. But obviously, the company does not want these 

resources exposed to the general public. From her house Jeannie uses a technology such 

as DSL or cable to connect to an Internet provider that routes some of her traffic to her 

office and the rest to other websites. Thus, she appears to her office like any other web 

user. She can also use a VPN for secure office communications.
Virtual private networks are created when the firewall interacts with an authentica-
tion service inside the perimeter. The firewall may pass user authentication data to the 

authentication server and, upon confirmation of the authenticated identity, the firewall 

provides the user with appropriate security privileges. For example, Jeannie may be 

allowed to access resources not available to general users. The firewall implements this 

access control on the basis of the VPN. A VPN with privileged access is shown in Fig-

ure 6-49. In that figure, the firewall passes to the internal server Jeannieâ€™s (privileged) 

identity.
Encryption is a powerful tool, but its use is fraught with problems. The algorithms 
run neatly by themselves, and many implementations in hardware and software are easy 

to use and reliable. Managing keys to support many virtual users is complex but table 

driven, making it a good task for computers. The keys must also be protected in storage 

on both ends.Firewall AOfficeA1A2A3A4EncryptedTo other
