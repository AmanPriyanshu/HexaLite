 Preface
 xxix  WHAT IS NEW IN THIS BOOK
This is the fifth edition of 
Security in Computing, 
first published in 1989. Since then, 
the specific threats, vulnerabilities, and controls have changed, as have many of the 

underlying technologies to which computer security applies. However, many basic con-

cepts have remained the same.
Most obvious to readers familiar with earlier editions will be some new chapters, 
specifically, on userâ€“web interaction and cloud computing, as well as the topics we 

raise in the emerging topics chapter. Furthermore, pulling together the three fundamen-

tal controls in Chapter 2 is a new structure. Those are the big changes, but every chapter 

has had many smaller changes, as we describe new attacks or expand on points that 

have become more important. 
One other feature some may notice is the addition of a third coauthor. Jonathan 
 Margulies joins us as an essential member of the team that produced this revision. He 

is currently director of the security practice at Qmulos, a newly launched security con-

sulting practice. He brings many years of experience with Sandia National Labs and 

the National Institute for Standards and Technology. His focus meshes nicely with our 

existing skills to extend the breadth of this book.
