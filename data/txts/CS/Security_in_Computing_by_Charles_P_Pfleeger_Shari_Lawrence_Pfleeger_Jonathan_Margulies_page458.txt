Networksattack tools first appeared in mid-1999. Some of the original DDoS tools include Tribal 
Flood Network (TFN), Trin00, and TFN2K (Tribal Flood Network, year 2000 edition). 

As new vulnerabilities that allow Trojan horses to be planted are discovered and as new 

denial-of-service attacks are found, new combination tools appear. For more details on 

this topic, see [HAN00].According to the U.S. Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) [HOU01b], 
scanning to find a vulnerable host (potential zombie) is now being included in combina-

tion tools; a single tool now identifies its zombie, installs the Trojan horse, and activates 

the zombie to wait for an attack signal. Symantec [SYM10] confirms that exploit packs 

now include code to turn a compromised system into a zombie. Recent target (zombie) 

selection has been largely random, meaning that attackers do not seem to care which 

zombies they infect. This revelation is actually bad news because it means that no orga-

nization or accessible host is safe from attack. Perhaps because they are so numerous 

and because their users are assumed to be less knowledgeable about computer man-

agement and protection, Windows-based machines are becoming more popular targets 

for attack than other systems. Most 
frightening is the finding we have 

already presented that the time is 

shrinking between discovery of a 

vulnerability and its widespread 

exploitation.
