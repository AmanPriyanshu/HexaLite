Details of Cryptographycombinations becomes the new right half; the old right half becomes the new left half. 
This sequence of activities, which constitutes a cycle, is shown in Figure 12-2. The 

cycles are repeated 16 times. After the last cycle is a final permutation, which is the 

inverse of the initial permutation.
These cycles are repeated 16 times for one 64-bit data block. This same process is 
repeated separately for each plaintext data block.
Complete DESNow we can put all the pieces back together, as shown in Figure 12-3. First, the key 
is reduced to 56 bits. Then, a block of 64 data bits is permuted by the initial permuta-

tion. Following are 16 cycles in which the key is shifted and permuted, half of the data 

block is transformed with the substitution and permutation functions, and the result is 
combined with the remaining half of the data block. After the last cycle, the data block 

is permuted with the final permutation.
