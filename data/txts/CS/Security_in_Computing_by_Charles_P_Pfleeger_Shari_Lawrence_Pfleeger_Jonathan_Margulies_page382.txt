Communications Media Strengths and Weaknesses
MediumStrengthsWeaknesses
Wire• Widely used
•  Inexpensive to buy, install, 
maintain• Susceptible to emanation
• Susceptible to physical wiretapping
Optical fiber• Immune to emanation
• Difficult to wiretap
•  Potentially exposed at connection 
pointsMicrowave•  Strong signal, not seriously 
affected by weather
•  Exposed to interception along path 
of transmission• Requires line of sight location

•  Signal must be repeated 
approximately every 30 miles 

(50 kilometers)Wireless (radio, WiFi)• Widely available
• Built into many computers
•  Signal degrades over distance; 
suitable for short range•  Signal interceptable in circular 
pattern around transmitterSatellite• Strong, fast signal•  Delay due to distance signal travels 
up and down
•  Signal exposed over wide area at 
receiving end
