NetworksSystem Architecture
If you are trying to limit the information a port scan reveals about a network and its 
hosts and services, the natural approach is to segment the network, with many hosts on 

segments that are not immediately visible to the outside.
As an example, think about a typical hospital telephone system. Some functions, 
such as human resources or patient services, need to accept calls directly from outsid-

ers, and those telephone numbers could be published in a directory. But you do not 

want the telephone number of the operating room or the diagnostics laboratory or even 

housekeeping or maintenance to be readily available to outsiders. The hospital would 

publish a general operator’s number; if an outsider has a convincing reason to need to be 

connected with the operating room, the operator can determine that and forward the call 

or perhaps redirect it to someone else who can be of better assistance. Certain execu-

tives may have administrative assistants who screen their calls, allowing some calls 

through immediately, taking messages for others, and redirecting still others. The archi-

tecture implicit in this description of a hospital’s telephone service is of a small number 

of externally accessible phones (relative to the larger number of internal phones), and a 

few other choke points that screen and redirect all other calls.
A similar situation occurs with networks. Compare the network of Figure 6-50(a) 
to that of Figure 6-50(b). In Figure 6-50(a), all five computers A–E are visible to the 

outside network, whereas in Figure 6-50(b) only computer A is visible. The network of 

devices B–E in part (b) is known as a 
protected subnet
, and device A is called a 
dual-homed gateway.AB(a)CDE(b)ABCDEFIGURE 6-50 (a) Visible Devices. (b) Less Visible Devices
