31  1.6 CONCLUSION
Computer security attempts to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of 
computing systems and their components. Three principal parts of a computing system 

are subject to attacks: hardware, software, and data. These three, and the communica-

tions among them, are susceptible to computer security vulnerabilities. In turn, those 
people and systems interested in compromising a system can devise attacks that exploit 

the vulnerabilities.In this chapter we have explained the following computer security concepts:
• Security situations arise in many everyday activities, although sometimes it can 
be difficult to distinguish between a security attack and an ordinary human or 

technological breakdown. Alas, clever attackers realize this confusion, so they 

may make their attack seem like a simple, random failure.
• A threat is an incident that could cause harm. A vulnerability is a weakness 
through which harm could occur. These two problems combine: Either without 

the other causes no harm, but a threat exercising a vulnerability means damage. 

To control such a situation, we can either block or diminish the threat, or close 

the vulnerability (or both).• Seldom can we achieve perfect security: no viable threats and no exercisable 
vulnerabilities. Sometimes we fail to recognize a threat, or other times we may 

be unable or unwilling to close a vulnerability. Incomplete security is not a bad 

situation; rather, it demonstrates a balancing act: Control certain threats and vul-

nerabilities, apply countermeasures that are reasonable, and accept the risk of 
harm from uncountered cases.Confidentiality
