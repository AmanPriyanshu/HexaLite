122 Chapter 2  
Toolbox: Authentication, Access Control, and Cryptography
A public key and user’s identity are bound together in a 
certificate
, which is then signed by someone called a certificate authority
, certifying the accuracy of the bind-
ing. In our example, the company might set up a certificate scheme in the following 

way. First, Edward selects a public key pair, posts the public part where everyone in the 

company can retrieve it, and retains the private part. Then, each division manager, such 

as Diana, creates her public key pair, puts the public key in a message together with her 

identity, and passes the message securely to Edward. Edward signs it by creating a hash 

value of the message and then encrypting the hash with his private key. By signing the 

message, Edward affirms that the public key (Diana’s) and the identity (also Diana’s) in 

the message are for the same person. This message is called Diana’s certificate.
All of Diana’s department managers create messages with their public keys, Diana 
hashes and signs each, and returns them. She also appends to each a copy of the certifi-

cate she received from Edward. In this way, anyone can verify a manager’s certificate by 

starting with Edward’s well-known public key, decrypting Diana’s certificate to retrieve 

her public key (and identity), and using Diana’s public key to decrypt the manager’s 

certificate. Figure 2-31 shows how certificates are created for Diana and one of her 

managers, Delwyn. This process continues down the hierarchy to Ann and Andrew. As 

shown in Figure 2-32, Andrew’s certificate is really his individual certificate combined 

with all certificates for those above him in the line to the president.
