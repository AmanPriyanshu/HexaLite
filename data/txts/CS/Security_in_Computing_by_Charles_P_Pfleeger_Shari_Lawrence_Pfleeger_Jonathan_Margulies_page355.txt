 Section 5.2  Security in the Design of Operating Systems 
321  • Memory protection
. Because each domain includes code and data stored in 
memory, the TCB must monitor memory references to ensure secrecy and integ-

rity for each domain.• I/O operation
. In some systems, software is involved with each character trans-
ferred in an I/O operation. This software connects a user program in the outer-

most domain to an I/O device in the innermost (hardware) domain. Thus, I/O 

operations can cross all domains.TCB Design The division of the operating system into TCB and non-TCB aspects is convenient for 

designers and developers because it means that all security-relevant code is located in 

one (logical) part. But the distinction is more than just logical. To ensure that the secu-

rity enforcement cannot be affected by non-TCB code, TCB code must run in some 

protected state that distinguishes it and protects it from interference or compromise by 
any code outside the TCB. Thus, the structuring into TCB and non-TCB must be done 

consciously.
