Operating Systemstable could allow an unauthorized user access but displaying the box is merely an inter-
face task. The functions listed would occur at different levels of the operating system. 

Thus, the user authentication functions are implemented in several places, as shown in 

Figure 5-3. A modern operating system has many different modules, as depicted in Figure 5-4. 
Not all this code comes from one source. Hardware device drivers may come from the 

device manufacturer or a third party, and users can install add-ons to implement a differ-

ent file system or user interface, for example. As you can guess, replacing the file system 

or user interface requires integration with several levels of the operating system. System 

tools, such as antivirus code, are said to “
hook” or be incorporated into the operating system; those tools are loaded along with the operating system so as to be active by the 

time user programs execute. Even though they come from different sources, all these 

modules, drivers, and add-ons may be collectively thought of as the operating system 

because they perform critical functions and run with enhanced privileges.
From a security standpoint these modules come from different sources, not all trust-
worthy, and must all integrate successfully. Operating system designers and testers have 

a nightmarish job to ensure correct functioning with all combinations of hundreds of 
different add-ons from different sources. All these pieces are maintained separately, so 

any module can change at any time, but such changes risk incompatibility.
