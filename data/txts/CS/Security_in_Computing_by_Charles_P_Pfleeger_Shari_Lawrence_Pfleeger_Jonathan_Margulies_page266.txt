232In this chapter:• Attacks against browsers
• Attacks against and from web sites

• Attacks seeking sensitive data

• Attacks through email
In this chapter we move beyond the general programs of the previous chapter to 

more specific code that supports user interaction with the Internet. Certainly, Inter-

net code has all the potential problems of general programs, and you should keep 
malicious code, buffer overflows, and trapdoors in mind as you read this chapter. How-

ever, in this chapter we look more specifically at the kinds of security threats and vul-

nerabilities that Internet access makes possible. Our focus here is on the user or client 

side: harm that can come to an individual user interacting with Internet locations. Then, 

in Chapter 6 we look at security networking issues largely outside the user’s realm or 

control, problems such as interception of communications, replay attacks, and denial of 
service.We begin this chapter by looking at browsers, the software most users perceive as 
the gateway to the Internet. As you already know, a browser is software with a relatively 

simple role: connect to a particular web address, fetch and display content from that 

address, and transmit data from a user to that address. Security issues for browsers arise 

from several complications to that simple description, such as these:
• A browser often connects to more than the one address shown in the browser’s 
address bar.
• Fetching data can entail accesses to numerous locations to obtain pictures, audio 
content, and other linked content.
• Browser software can be malicious or can be corrupted to acquire malicious 
functionality.
• Popular browsers support add-ins, extra code to add new features to the browser, 
but these add-ins themselves can include corrupting code.
