 Section 6.2  Threats to Network Communications 
359  Unknown Perimeter A networkâ€™s expandability also implies uncertainty about the network boundary. One host 

may be a node on two different networks, so resources on one network are accessible to 

the users of the other network as well. Although wide accessibility is an advantage, this 

unknown or uncontrolled group of possibly malicious users is a security disadvantage. 
A similar problem occurs when new hosts can be added to the network. Every net-
work node must be able to react to the possible presence of new, untrustable hosts. 

Figure 6-7 points out the problems in defining the boundaries of a network. Notice, for 

example, that a user on a host in network D may be unaware of the potential connec-

tions from users of networks A and B. And the host in the middle of networks A and B 

in fact belongs to A, B, C, and E. If these networks have different security rules, to what 

rules is that host subject?Unknown Path Figure 6-8 illustrates that there may be many paths from one host to another. Suppose 

that a user on host A1 wants to send a message to a user on host B3. That message might 

be routed through hosts C or D before arriving at host B3. Host C may provide accept-

able security, but D does not. Network users seldom have control over the routing of 

their messages. Inability to control routing figures in the interception of mobile phone 

signals, as described in Sidebar 6-5.Network E Network D Network A Network  B
