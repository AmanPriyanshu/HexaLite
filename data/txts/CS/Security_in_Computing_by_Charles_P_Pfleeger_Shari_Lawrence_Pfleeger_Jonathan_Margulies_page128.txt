rithms are typically 64, 128, 256 bits or more. The block size need not have any par-

ticular relationship to the size of a character. Block ciphers work on blocks of plaintext 

and produce blocks of ciphertext, as 

shown in Figure 2-21. In the figure, 

the central box represents an encryp-
tion machine: The previous plaintext 

pair is converted to 
po, the current one being converted is 
IH, and the machine is soon to convert 
ES.Table 2-10 lists the advantages and disadvantages of stream and block encryption 
algorithms.With this description of the characteristics of different encryption algorithms we can 
now turn to some widely used encryption algorithms. We present how each works, a bit 

of the historical context and motivation for each, and some strengths and weaknesses. 

We identify these algorithms by name because these names appear in the popular litera-

ture. We also introduce other symmetric algorithms in Chapter 12. Of course you should 

recognize that these are just examples of popular algorithms; over time these algorithms 

may be superseded by others. To a large degree cryptography has become plug-and-

play, meaning that in an application developers can substitute one algorithm for another 

of the same type and similar characteristics. In that way advancements in the field of 

cryptography do not require that all applications using cryptography be rewritten.
Stream ciphers encrypt one bit or one 

byte at a time; block ciphers encrypt a 
fixed number of bits as a single chunk.
