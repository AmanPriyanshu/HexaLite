 Section 12.2  Symmetric Encryption Algorithms 
791  after the launch of DES, the power of individual specialized processors and of massive 
parallel searches finally overtook the fixed DES key size.
We must ask the same questions about AES: Does it have flaws, and for how long 
will it remain sound? We cannot address the question of flaws yet, other than to say that 

teams of cryptanalysts pored over the design of Rijndael during the two-year review 

period without finding any problems. Furthermore, since AES was adopted in 2001, 

the only serious challenges to its security have been highly specialized and theoretical.
The longevity question is more difficult, but also more optimistic, to answer for AES 
than for DES. Remember that extending the key by one bit doubles the effort of a brute 

force attack. The AES algorithm as defined can use 128-, 192-, or 256-bit keys. Thus, 

relative to a 56-bit DES key, a 128-bit AES key results in 72 doublings, which means 

the work is 2
72 (approximately 4
*1021) times as hard. Key lengths of 192 and 256 bits 
extend this already prodigious effort even more. But because there is an evident under-

lying structure to AES, it is even possible to use the same general approach on a slightly 

different underlying problem and accommodate keys of even larger size. Thus, unlike 

DES, AES lets users move to longer keys any time technology threatens to allow an 

analyst to overtake the current key size, and so Diffie and Hellmanâ€™s conjecture of 1977 

is unlikely to apply to AES at any time in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, this 

extended key length builds in a margin of safety if clever attacks divide the effort in a 

brute force attack.SSSSkkkk 1.  Byte Sub2.
