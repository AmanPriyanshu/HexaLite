 Section 12.4  Message Digests 
801  SHA-3NIST also commenced a competition in 2008 to select a new hash algorithm to be known 
as SHA-3. In 2012 NIST formally announced selection of Keccak [NIS14, BER14] as 

winner, to be designated SHA-3; like SHA-2 it is also a family of algorithms.
Immediately after the announcement there arose a controversy because of changes 
NIST sought in the internal algorithm. The basis of concern was a fear that NSA had 

somehow weakened the internals to make the algorithm easier for it to break. In fact, 

it seems that NIST requested some minor changes for performance reasons, but those 

changes do not weaken the algorithm. Cryptologist Bruce Schneier essentially put such 

concerns to rest in his blog [SCH13]:The Keccak permutation remains unchanged. What NIST proposed was reducing the 
hash function’s capacity in the name of performance. One of Keccak’s nice features is 

that it’s highly tunable.
I do not believe that the NIST changes were suggested by the NSA. Nor do I believe 
that the changes make the algorithm easier to break by the NSA. I believe NIST made 

the changes in good faith, and the result is a better security/performance trade-off.
The structure of SHA-3 is different from its predecessors in that it uses far fewer 
cycles, thus improving performance significantly. The algorithms do use significantly 

more internal memory (1600 bits as opposed to 512 for SHA-2), but the added space is 

available for most application domains.
Properties of MD5 and the SHA algorithms are presented in Table 12-1.
